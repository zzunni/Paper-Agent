ABSTRACT - We report the formation of sub-5 nm ultrashallow junctions in 4” Si wafers 
enabled by the molecular monolayer doping of phosphorous and boron atoms and the use of 
conventional spike annealing. The junctions are characterized by secondary ion mass 
spectrometry and non-contact sheet resistance measurements. It is found that the majority 
(~70%) of the incorporated dopants are electrically active, therefore, enabling a low sheet 
resistance for a given dopant areal dose. The wafer-scale uniformity is investigated and found to 
be limited by the temperature homogeneity of the spike anneal tool used in the experiments. 
Notably, minimal junction leakage currents (<1 µA/cm2) are observed which highlights the 
quality of the junctions formed by this process. The results clearly demonstrate the versatility 
and potency of the monolayer doping approach for enabling controlled, molecular-scale 
ultrashallow junction formation without introducing defects in the semiconductor.

Device scaling has been the main driving force for the technology advancement in the 
semiconductor industry over the last few decades.1,2 Specifically, junction depths have been 
scaled continuously together with the gate lengths in order to achieve faster transistor speeds and 
higher packing densities. Historically, source/drain extension junction depths of ~1/3 of the 
transistor gate lengths have been used for efficient electrostatics and acceptable leakage currents. 
With the gate lengths fast approaching the sub-10 nm regimes, it is vital to realize sub-5 nm 
ultrashallow junctions (USJs) with low sheet resistivity (i.e., low parasitic contact resistance) to 
facilitate the future scaling of transistors. However, there are tremendous technological 
challenges for achieving sub-5 nm USJs as the conventional doping strategies suffer from a 
number of setbacks.1,2 The current USJs are fabricated by the combination of ion implantation 
and spike annealing. During the process, Si atoms are displaced by energetic dopant ions and a 
subsequent annealing step (e.g., spike, a high temperature anneal process of less than 1s with fast 
temperature ramp up/down capability) is used to activate the dopants by moving them into the 
appropriate lattice positions and restoring the substrate’s crystal quality. However, point defects 
such as Si interstitials and vacancies are also generated, which interact with the dopants to 
further broaden the junction profile. This is known as the transient enhanced diffusion (TED)3 
which limits the formation of sub-10nm USJs by conventional technologies. Moreover, there are 
significant research efforts to develop new strategies such as utilizing heavier implantation 
dopant sources (molecular implantation4, gas cluster ion beam5 and plasma doping6) to obtain 
shallower doping profiles, and advanced annealing techniques (flash7 and laser8) to activate the 
implanted dopants without causing significant diffusion. However, very little is known on the 
effects of advanced doping and annealing techniques on the junction uniformity, reliability and 
subsequent process integration which may hamper their use in the IC manufacturing. To address

the need for advanced doping strategies, recently, we reported a new technique for controlled, 
nanoscale surface doping of semiconductor materials by utilizing the crystalline nature of silicon 
and its self-limiting surface reaction properties to form self-assembled dopant monolayers 
followed by a subsequent annealing step for the incorporation and diffusion of dopants.9 Due to 
the lack of damage to the lattice during this surface doping strategy, minimal TED effects are 
expected which presents a major advantage of this technology for achieving nanoscale junctions. 
Previously, we reported junction depths down to ~20 nm by utilizing the monolayer doping 
method and 5 sec rapid thermal diffusion.9 Here, we explore and characterize the junction depth 
limits of this process on wafer-scale and in detail through materials and electrical 
characterizations. Uniquely, for the first time, we demonstrate sub-5 nm junction depths (down 
to ~2nm; at the limit of most characterization methods) with low sheet resistivity, even for fast 
diffusing dopants such as phosphorous. 
 
The monolayer doping (MLD) process is based on the formation of self-assembled 
dopant-containing monolayer on the crystalline silicon surfaces, followed by the subsequent 
diffusion of dopants from the surface into the lattice by a thermal annealing step (Fig. 1).   In 
detail, for the phosphorous-MLD (P-MLD) process, 4” p-type Si wafers were first treated with 
dilute hydrofluoric acid (~1%) to remove the native SiO2. The Si surface was then reacted with 
diethyl 1-propylphosphonate (DPP, Alfa Aesar) and mesitylene as a solvent (25:1, v/v) for 2.5 h 
at 120oC to assemble a P-containing monolayer. The details of this reaction and the monolayer 
formation kinetics have been reported elsewhere.9,10 Then, a layer of ~50nm thick SiO2 is 
electron-beam evaporated as a cap, and the substrate is spike annealed between 900-1050oC in 
Ar ambient to drive in the P atoms and achieve n+/p USJs. The spike annealing is performed in a 
rapid thermal processing tool (AG Associate, model 610) with a fast ramping rate of 100oC/s to

the target temperature. During the annealing, the 4” Si wafer is placed on top of a 6” pocket 
wafer and temperature is monitored by the pyrometer controlling system. A similar approach was 
applied to 4” n-type Si wafers for boron-MLD (B-MLD) for which hydrogen terminated Si 
wafers were reacted with allylboronic acid pinacol ester (ABAPE, Aldrich) and mesitylene as a 
solvent (25:1, v/v) at 120ºC for 2.5 hr to enable a B-containing monolayer which is then capped 
with SiO2 followed by spike anneal to enable the formation of p+/n USJs.9 Finally, the oxide cap 
is removed and the enabled junctions are characterized. 
Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were performed to characterize 
the dopant profiles. Figure 2A illustrates the phosphorous SIMS profiling for P-MLD with spike 
anneal temperatures of 950-1050ºC. Notably, for all samples, there is a dramatic change in the P 
profile at the concentration of 1~5x1019 atoms/cm3, which is known as the “kink-and-tail” 
characteristic. This behavior has been commonly observed for the conventional phosphorus 
doping schemes11 and is attributed to the changeover from the vacancy assisted diffusion 
mechanism (at high P concentration region) to the kick-out diffusion mechanism (at low P 
concentration region).12 From the temperature dependency, two trends are clearly evident. First, 
the surface concentration of incorporated P monotonically increases with the annealing 
temperature (Fig. 2B). Specifically, surface doping concentrations of No ~ 2.5x1020, 3.5 x1020, 
4x1020, 5.5x1020 atoms/cm3 are observed for 900, 950, 1000, 1050 ºC, respectively. This trend is 
consistent with the constant source, surface diffusion model, in which No is governed by the 
dopant solubility limit at the diffusion temperature. In fact, the observed temperature dependency 
of No is in close agreement with the previously reported solid solubility limits (Fig. 2B).13,14 In 
the MLD process, the maximum areal dose, Q, corresponds to the monolayer packing density 
(~8x1014 molecules/cm2 assuming a molecular footprint of ~0.12 nm2); hence, at a first glance, it 

===== Page 5 =====

may seem that the limited source diffusion model is more applicable. However, in this work, 
since spike annealing is applied, the monolayer packing density is higher than the areal dose of 
the incorporated/diffused dopants. Therefore, within the context of this work, constant source 
model may be applied as a rough guideline in predicting the doping profile behaviors.  
The second clear trend observed from the SIMS profiling is a monotonic increase in the 
junction depth and areal dopant dose with the diffusion temperature.  The junction depth, xj is 
defined as the depth at which the incorporated P concentration equates the background B 
concentration of the substrate (~5x1018 B atoms/cm3), while Q is extracted by integrating the 
total area of the dopant profiles. Notably, the substrate concentration of 5x1018 atoms/cm3 used 
here is the same as the channel doping density for the state-of-the art Si MOSFETs. We extract xj 
~ 2, 5, 7, 25 nm and Q ~ 5.5x1012, 1.0x1013, 1.7x1013, 7.5x1013 P atoms/cm2 for 900, 950, 1000, 
1050ºC spike anneals, respectively (Fig. 2C). This trend is expected and arises from the 
enhanced diffusivity and solubility of P in Si at higher diffusion temperatures. It should be noted 
that given the finite temperature ramp time (~100ºC/s) of our rapid thermal annealing tool, the 
diffusion time is also effectively increased for the samples treated at higher annealing 
temperatures, which may also attribute to the observed temperature dependency of the dopant 
dose.  
The sub-5 nm USJs with high Q enabled by MLD are highly attractive, and clearly 
demonstrates the potency and viability of this technology for future nanoscale CMOS fabrication 
processing. This unique feature of MLD arises from the lack of TED during the dopant 
incorporation which is in distinct contrast to the ion implantation process. Additionally, in the 
MLD process, the incorporated dopant atoms near the surface are not lost during the SiO2 cap 
(i.e. mask) removal step, owing to the high etch selectivity of the oxide over crystalline Si.  This 

===== Page 6 =====

is in distinct contrast to the ion implantation process in which the post-implantation mask 
removal and surface cleaning steps lead to some dopant (and Si) loss near the surface due to the 
enhanced etch rate and reduced etch selectivity of the damaged (nearly amorphized by the 
implanted ions) top Si layer. Uniquely, this work shows that conventional annealing methods can 
indeed enable sub-5 nm USJs when dopants are introduced from the surface which is yet another 
beneficial aspect of MLD since the uniformity and reliability of sub-milli-second, nonequilibrium annealing methods7,8 (i.e., flash and laser) are still unknown and under active 
investigation. 
While SIMS is highly valuable for obtaining the overall dopant profiles, some uncertainty 
and error may be expected in the measured profiles, especially for the first 1-2 nm depths from 
the surface and even when the measurement tool is cautiously operated near the depth resolution 
limit (see Supporting Information). Additionally, SIMS does not provide information on the 
electrically active content of the incorporated dopants, which is critical for the device 
applications. Therefore, to further characterize the n+/p USJs and examine the electrically active 
concentration of the incorporated dopants, sheet resistance (Rs) measurements are imperative.  
Accurate Rs measurements, however, are quite challenging for USJs. Specifically, conventional 
contact-mode, four-point probe measurements cannot be utilized for sub-10nm USJs because of 
the probe penetration into the surface of the substrate.15 This probe penetration causes significant 
junction damage and leakage which underestimates the true Rs with a corresponding error as high 
as 100% or more.15 In this aspect, we utilized the non-contact Rs technique to electrically 
characterize our USJs. Briefly, this method is relied on the principle of measuring the difference 
in the surface photo-voltage between two non-contact, voltage probes as induced by an external 
light source (Fig. 3). By varying the light modulation frequency, the spatially resolved surface

voltage can yield an accurate estimation of Rs and the junction leakage current density with the 
details reported elsewhere.16 Figure 4 shows the non-contact Rs wafer maps for the n+/p 
junctions enabled by MLD. Average Rs ~ 12000, 3670, 3160, 825 Ω/□ are observed for the 900, 
950, 1000 and 1050oC spike anneals, respectively. This temperature dependency is expected due 
to the higher diffusivity and solubility of dopants (i.e., higher Q) at higher temperatures, which 
effectively results in higher free carrier concentrations and lower Rs.  
From the wafer-scale Rs maps, a modest standard deviation of σ≤ 30% is obtained for all 
samples, except for the 900oC spike annealed wafer (Fig. 4). The large variation (σ~100%) in the 
Rs for the 900oC spike wafer may be due to the average measured Rs ~12,000 Ω/□ being close to 
the resolution limit of the non-contact Rs measurement set up. Notably, clear rotational symmetry 
is observed in the Rs maps for all samples with Rs being highly uniform (σ<5%) within each 
circular “ring” boundaries. This variation pattern is a signature of the spatial imbalance in the 
power density of the heater lamp17 which may be expected since the annealing tool used in this 
study was not designed for spike anneal applications18. Notably, the “ring” pattern is off-centered 
for the 1050oC wafer (Fig. 4D) because the wafer was misaligned from the center of the support 
substrate during the annealing step, again indicative of the role of the non-uniform heating in the 
observed Rs variation. Given that Rs is highly uniform within each “ring”, we speculate that in 
the future, a higher uniformity across the wafer may be attained by MLD if a more sophisticated 
spike annealing tool is used. This is an expected feature of MLD since the dopants are 
deterministically positioned on the surface of the wafer through a self-limiting monolayer 
formation reaction, therefore, providing a high degree of control in the uniformity of surface 
dopant coverage prior to the diffusion step.

            In order to compare our P-MLD processed n+/p USJs with those achieved by other 
doping technologies, we complied the literature reported Rs and xj values for phosphorus doped 
junctions as depicted in Fig. 5A.19,20,21,22,23 From the literature, the smallest xj~13nm at the 
background concentration of 5x1018 atoms/cm3 was reported with Rs ~650 Ω/□. To the best of 
our knowledge, there is no previous report of sub-10nm n+/p USJs based on the phosphorous 
diffusion in part because of the high diffusivity of P, highlighting the elegance of MLD in 
achieving nm-scale junctions, even for fast diffusing impurities. Notably, for xj~25nm, the Rs 
values obtained from MLD are comparable (within a factor of ~2) with those obtained by other 
conventional doping methods (Fig. 5A). Moreover, a simple, analytical constant-source diffusion 
modeling (P in Si) was carried out (Fig. 5A) to further shed light on the MLD experimental data 
(see Supp. Info. for details). The experimental values qualitatively fit the modeling trend, again 
demonstrating the near ideal behavior of the MLD process. 
 
From the SIMS and Rs measurements, the phosphorous activation efficiency, η, was 
directly obtained for each diffusion temperature (Fig. 5B) in order to shed light on the percentage 
of the incorporated dopants that are electrically active. Specifically, Rs was estimated from the 
SIMS profiles by equation 1 and then compared to the non-contact Rs measurement values,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eq. 1 
where q, µ, N and x are the elemental charge, electron mobility, dopant concentration and depth, 
respectively. The efficiency is then defined as                     . Figure 5B shows the extracted 
efficiencies of η~70% for spike annealing temperatures ≥ 950oC with η~30% for the 900 oC 
spike anneal. The discrepancy between the measured and calculated Rs values may be attributed 
to some percentage of the diffused dopants that are incorporated in sites other than substitutional

lattice sites.12 However, since in the MLD, dopants are introduced from the surface by an 
equilibrium process, we expect the diffusion of dopants to be dominated by the substitutional 
mechanism, resulting in nearly all the incorporated dopants being electrically active. Therefore, 
we speculate that the small discrepancy between the measured and calculated Rs values arise 
from the uncertainty in the SIMS profiles.  This error is particularly magnified for the 900oC 
wafer since the observed junction depth is only ~2 nm for this sample, right at the resolution 
limit of SIMS. The high η estimated from the data analysis is yet another highly attractive 
feature of MLD since for device applications, only the electrically active contents are desirable 
with other dopants inducing defects and/or junction leakage currents. 
Since organic molecular precursors are utilized as the dopant source, carbon 
incorporation during the dopant diffusion may be expected, which may enhance the highly 
undesired junction leakage currents. Therefore, investigations of C incorporation and the arising 
junction properties are needed. However, SIMS measurements do not provide accurate C depth 
profiling near the surface region due to the atmospheric organic surface which is unavoidable 
even if a pre-measurement cleaning step is performed on the samples.24 Instead, in order to 
directly characterize the effect of potential carbon incorporation, the junction leakage current 
density was measured by the non-contact, photo-voltage measurement. Figure S3 illustrates the 
leakage wafer map for the n+/p junctions for various spike temperatures. The average leakage 
currents of ~0.13, 0.55, 0.11, 0.31 µA/cm2 were measured for the 900, 950, 1000, 1050 oC spike 
anneals, respectively. Notably, the small leakage currents (<1 µA/cm2) are close to the resolution 
limit of the instrument, and attests to the high quality junctions that are enabled by MLD. The 
results suggest that carbon content incorporation may not be of a concern for MLD, at least when

considering the junction leakage currents, which are smaller than the start-of-the-art USJs’ 
leakage currents.25  
In addition to the n+/p junctions, we also investigated the formation of p+/n USJs by 
boron-MLD with spike annealing. From SIMS measurements, sub-2 nm junction depths (xj ~ 1 
and 2 nm) are obtained for 950 and 1050oC spike, respectively (Fig. S1), which is close to the 
resolution limit of SIMS. The shallower junctions enabled at the same diffusion temperature for 
B-MLD as compared to P-MLD is expected due to the lower diffusivity of B. Since the B-MLD 
p+/n junctions are at the molecular-scale, the Rs values were higher than ~10,000 Ω/□ for all 
spike conditions, and therefore, out of the measurement range of the non-contact photo-voltage 
characterization technique. In the future, more advanced electrical and materials characterization 
methods, such as local electrode atom probe microscopy need to be utilized to further study the 
amazingly shallow p+/n USJs enabled by MLD. 
In summary, we have demonstrated the wafer-scale formation of n+/p and p+/n USJs by 
the combination of self-limiting monolayer doping and the conventional spike annealing. This 
approach is demonstrated on 4” Si wafers with the junction uniformity limited by the 
temperature homogeneity of the spike anneal tool. For phosphorous doping, we report for the 
first time, sub-10 nm junction formation (down to 2nm – the SIMS resolution limit) with the 
non-contact Rs measurements being consistent with the predicted values from the dopant profiles. 
Additionally, we find minimal junction leakage currents which are indicative of high quality, 
defect-free USJs enabled by MLD. Notably, besides nano-scale controlled doping for the contact 
extension of future MOSFETs, this surface doping technology also may be highly applicable for 
the conformal and deterministic doping of non-planar nanoscale device structures, such as FinFETs or nanowire-FETs.
