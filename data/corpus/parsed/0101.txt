Abstract  
 
Heteroepitaxy on nanopatterned substrates is a means of defect reduction at 
semiconductor heterointerfaces by exploiting substrate compliance and enhanced 
elastic lattice relaxation resulting from reduced dimensions. We explore this possibility 
in the InAs/GaAs(111)A system using a combination of nanosphere lithography and 
reactive ion etching of the GaAs(111)A substrate for nano-patterning of the substrate, 
yielding pillars with honeycomb and hexagonal arrangements and varied nearest 
neighbor distances. Substrate patterning is followed by MBE growth of InAs at 
temperatures of 150 - 350qC and growth rates of 0.011 nm/s and 0.11 nm/s. InAs 
growth in the form of nano-islands on the pillar tops is achieved by lowering the adatom 
migration length by choosing a low growth temperature of 150qC at the growth rate 
0.011 nm/s. The choice of a higher growth rate of 0.11 nm/s results in higher InAs 
island nucleation and the formation of hillocks concentrated at the pillar bases due to 
a further reduction of adatom migration length. A common feature of the growth 
morphology for all other explored conditions is the formation of merged hillocks or 
pyramids with well-defined facets due to the presence of a concave surface curvature 
at the pillar bases acting as adatom sinks.

1. Introduction 
 
Growth of lattice mismatched III-V compound semiconductors on nanopatterned 
substrates is interesting for the fabrication of site-controlled and low-defect 
semiconductor 
layers 
and 
nanostructures. 
Among 
the 
zinc-blende 
III-V 
semiconductors InAs exhibits properties that are attractive for optoelectronic 
applications, namely a narrow bandgap, a high electron mobility and alloying capability 
with other III-Vs. Site-controlled growth of InAs and InxGa1-xAs quantum dots and 
(lateral) nanowires has been achieved on substrates patterned with nanoscale holes 
or grooves by making use of the high In mobility in conjunction with the surface 
curvature driven chemical potential landscape [1,2]. When growing heteroepitaxial 
semiconductors on nanoscale, laterally freestanding substrate areas like the top faces 
of pillars or ridges, the enhanced elastic strain relaxation aids to reduce the density of 
misfit-related defects [3]. Moreover, specific arrangements of III-V nanostructures can 
be realized on such patterned growth areas. For example, Konkar et al. found evidence 
for the formation of single, double and triple rows of InAs quantum dots on top of 
GaAs(001) nanomesa stripes which were obtained by size-reducing epitaxy [4]. While 
some studies analyze InAs heteroepitaxy on nanopatterned GaAs(001), there is a lack 
of knowledge on InAs growth on nanopatterned GaAs(111)A. The InAs/GaAs(111)A 
system is characterized by a low binding energy of In adatom sites [5] and slow In-Asx 
(x = 2, 4) reaction kinetics leading to a high In adatom mobility [6] and preference for 
2D layer growth on planar GaAs(111)A [7,8]. These characteristics may provide the 
ground for the realization of tailored InAs nanostructures on nanopatterned 
GaAs(111)A.  
In the present contribution we explore the influence of MBE growth conditions, i.e. 
temperature and growth rate, on InAs heteroepitaxy on nanopillar-patterned

GaAs(111)A substrates. The resulting growth morphologies are discussed in terms of 
the In adatom surface migration length. For the nanopatterning we employ selforganized nanosphere lithography (NSL), which is a low-cost and high-throughput 
technique, followed by reactive ion etching (RIE). 
 
2. Experimental  
 
All experiments were performed on sixths of 3-inch GaAs(111)A wafers procured from 
MaTeck GmbH. Surface nanopatterning starts with the deposition of mono- and 
doublelayers of 220 nm diameter polystyrene spheres with 3% coefficient of variation, 
using an aqueous suspension with 10% solid fraction from Thermo Fischer Inc. Selforganization of beads is initiated by spreading the suspension with a doctor blade on 
a hydrophilized GaAs substrate. Either mono- or doublelayers of hexagonally stacked 
sphere layers result from convective self-assembly [9,10] and can be used as shadow 
mask for deposition of a metallic hard mask. In the present study, triangular or 
hexagonal sphere mask openings with a pitch of 1.155 r or 2.0 r, corresponding to 
mono- or double ayers, respectively, [11] were realised, with r being the radius of 
polymer spheres used. Thermal evaporation of nickel onto the sphere mono- or 
doublelayers and subsequent dissolution of polymer spheres in tetrahydrofuran 
resulted in the formation of hexagonal arrays of nickel dots. RIE of the substrate using 
SiCl4 plasma (5 sccm, 3.5 mTorr, 195 W RF, 55 s in a Plasmalab 100, Oxford 
Instruments) resulted in the formation of GaAs pillar-patterned substrates with pillar 
diameters of | 40 and 25 nm for mono- and doublelayer sphere arrays, respectively, 
and a height of about 90 nm. The mean separation between the nearest-neighbour 
pillars was 131 r 6 nm and 232 r 7 nm, the larger separation corresponding to

doublelayer regions. A detailed description of GaAs nano-pillar array fabrication on 
GaAs(111)A substrates is given in ref. [12]. 
 
In preparation of the heteroepitaxial growth, the nanopatterned substrates were 
immersed first in diluted H2SO4 to dissolve the Ni hard mask and then in diluted HF 
solution to dissolve the surface oxide. Residual surface oxides were removed using 
atomic hydrogen cleaning for 3 minutes at 350qC in the MBE growth chamber 
immediately before growth. 
The MBE overgrowth of the nanopillar- patterned GaAs with nominally 15 nm InAs (if 
not stated otherwise) was performed at a constant As4 beam equivalent pressure of 
approximately 2.5 u 10-5 mbar. The objective of MBE growth studies was to understand 
the effect of growth temperature, growth rate and indium cell inclination on the 
morphology of InAs formed at pillars with different pillar size and area densities. A 
summary of growth conditions is presented in Table 1. All InAs growth experiments 
were performed at a fixed As source flux angle of 40° with respect to the substrate 
normal, while the In source was placed at inclinations of either 5q or 40q to the substrate 
normal. The samples were rotated at a speed of 10 rpm to achieve an azimuthal 
direction-independent exposure of the patterned substrate surface to the As4 and In 
beams .The chosen parameters of our experiments allow us thus to explore the effect 
of temperature, growth rate, deposition angle, and GaAs nanopillar arrangement on 
InAs/GaAs nano-heteroepitaxy. 
The growth morphology of the InAs epilayers was characterized using a field-emission 
scanning electron microscope (Raith Pioneer) operated at 10 kV and transmission 
electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-ARM200F, Cs-probe corrected) at 200 kV in brightfield TEM and high-angle annular dark-field STEM modes. For investigation of the

surface morphology of the InAs growth an atomic force microscope (AFM) NanoSurf 
Mobile S operated in the contact mode was used. For estimation of the area fraction 
of microstructural features, the open source image analysis software ImageJ was 
employed. 
 
Table 1. Growth parameters employed in this study. The As4 beam equivalent pressure 
was maintained at approximately 2.5 u 10-5 mbar during all experiments. For all 
samples compiled here the nominal InAs thickness is 15 nm. 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
Nanopillar-patterned areas of approximately 1.3 cm u 2.5 cm were obtained by 
nanosphere lithography and RIE as described in Section 2. Typical patterns fabricated 
by using sphere monolayers are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to nanopillars features, 
arrays contain defects (notably line defects or pattern defects) owing to imperfect 
sphere arrangement in the NSL step. Such defects can give extra information on the 
influence of surface morphology on the InAs growth.

3.1 InAs grown on monolayer-patterned areas   
Fig. 2 depicts SEM images of InAs overgrown pillar-patterned GaAs obtained from 
sphere monolayers. A common feature observed is the preferential growth of InAs 
hillocks around GaAs pillars. In top view, the hillocks show a morphology resembling 
triangles or triangles with truncated corners, which are also sometimes coalesced (Fig. 
2 (a) and (b)). The edges of these triangles are oriented along the < 11̅0 > directions 
and the normals to these edges in the (111) plane are oriented along the < 112̅ > 
directions.Under As rich conditions, the GaAs(111)A surface adopts a 2 u 2 surface 
reconstruction, the potential energy surface (PES) of In adatoms on which has minima 
oriented along the < 11̅0 > directions [13], which provides a low energy path for Indium 
adatoms to migrate. This results in a diffusion anisotropy and thus the step edges of 
InAs hillocks are oriented along the < 11̅0 > directions. 
Formation of such hillocks with edges oriented along the < 11̅0 > directions is widely 
reported in literature [14, 15, 16] for homo- and heteroepitaxial growth on fcc (111)

surfaces. A high Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier [17] at step edges of 2D islands restricts 
the downward motion of adatoms and facilitates 3D growth by increasing their 
residence time on a 2D terrace and thus also the probability of forming new 2D layers 
on top of existing ones [18,19]. This effect, together with the diffusion anisotropy and 
the low energy of {110} type facets is responsible for the formation of the observed 
hillocks during MBE growth. In the present study, the concave base edges of GaAs 
nanopillars and line defects act as adatom sinks [20] and are the preferred sites for 
formation of hillocks, as seen in Fig. 2 (a)-(h). Hence, unlike in most of the studies 
carried out on planar substrates, in the present study the sites for the formation of 
hillocks are not random positions. A feature observable on closer examination in the 
case of samples grown at 300qC and 350qC is the presence of step bunches (Fig. 2 
(a), (b) and (c)), which indicates that growth is mediated by the step flow growth 
mechanism.  
The effect of InAs growth rate on growth morphology is considered first on the basis of 
images in Fig. 2 (b), (f) and (c), (g). The most noticeable difference between Fig. 2 (b) 
and (c) is the reduced degree of coalescence of adjacent hillocks at the higher growth 
rate (Fig. 2 c). In this case, the higher In adatom flux increases the nucleation rate and 
as a consequence reduces the migration length on account of the increased probability 
of adatom capture by newly formed islands [17] on the hillock and also on the planar 
substrate between pillars. In the present case, further InAs growth takes place 
preferably on the widely relaxed surfaces of the existing InAs hillocks and at the kink 
and steps present on the pillar sidewalls. We also observe that all the hillocks are 
oriented in the same direction throughout the sample for all samples reported here.  
 
Now let us consider the temperature dependence and the influence of deposition 
angle. Merged hillocks with step bunches on their surface (Fig. 2(a)) and well-defined

facet surfaces (Fig. 2 (e)) are observable in the case of a sample grown at 350°C (Fig. 
2 (e), sample T2). The InAs growth morphology of a sample grown at the same 
substrate temperature but with an inclined In cell (sample T2’) is the same as for normal 
incidence of In. A SEM top view image for inclined deposition is shown in the 
Supplementary Materials section S1, Fig. S1 (a). There is no pronounced 
morphological difference between samples grown at 350 and 300°C (Fig. 2 (a), (e) and 
(b), (f), respectively). In comparison, at 150°C (Fig. 2 (d), (h)) the edges of hillock’s 
facets look irregular and no signatures of step bunching are observable. Yet another 
difference is visible, i.e. the presence of numerous small islands on the planar 
substrate areas and the formation of nano-islands on the pillar tops of this sample. 
 
These observations reflect the role of growth temperature in regulating the migration 
length which decreases exponentially with temperature. In addition to this the 
incorporation rate of As is strongly enhanced by a reduction of GaAs(111)A substrate 
temperature [21]. This also enhances the nucleation rate and promotes the formation 
of InAs islands on the planar substrate surfaces. For all other temperatures above 
150°C examined in this study, the pillar tops were observed to be devoid of InAs islands 
(also confirmed using cross-sectional TEM, not shown here).

An estimate of the dimensions of InAs islands was made using bright-field TEM images 
such as in Fig. 3 (a). The average diameter and height were found to be 21 nm and 15 
nm, respectively. The bright-field image in Fig. 3 (a) and the HAADF-STEM image in 
Fig. 3 (b) also reveal the growth of InAs on the pillar side walls as well as at the base 
of the pillars. An analysis of HAADF-STEM images from GaAs nano-pillars overgrown 
with InAs at the same conditions as sample T1 but with lower deposited InAs thickness 
(2 nm) reveals the presence of a thin InAs wetting layer (Information presented in 
Supplementary Materials section S2). The detection of such a wetting layer points to 
the possibility of InAs growing on top of GaAs pillars via a Stranski-Krastanov type of 
mechanism.  
The projected area fraction covered with InAs for the samples compiled in Table 1 is 
represented in Fig. 4. The projected areas were estimated by manually coloring and 
thresholding top view SEM images like in Fig. 2(a-d) to enable the estimation of area 
fractions occupied with InAs in hillocks. This manual approach was chosen to allow for 
an exclusion of defective pattern areas in the analysis. Defect free monolayer patterned 
regions with a minimum size of 0.3 Pm2 were used to estimate the average projected 
area fraction of InAs. The sequences involved in such image processing are outlined 
in the Supplementary Materials section S3.

 At least five such areas excluding line defects and containing a minimum of 360 pillars 
were analyzed to compute the standard deviation shown as vertical bars in the plot of 
Fig. 4. Fig. 4 reveals a decline of the projected area fraction of InAs hillock coverage 
with an increase in growth temperature for samples grown with a constant growth rate

of 0.011 nm/s. Such a trend is the result of enhanced adatom migration towards the 
bases of pillars and line defects in the pattern, which reduces the amount of InAs 
growing in the free areas between the pillars. The data points (shown in red) 
corresponding to samples T2 and T2’ with identical temperature of 350°C but different 
In effusion cell inclination angles show an almost perfect coincidence. This suggests 
that at least at the highest temperature the growth morphologies depend on growth 
kinetics rather than on the direction of adatom arrival. A difference of 26% in InAs 
coverage is observed between the two samples grown at 300°C at different growth 
rates. This is a result of differences in lateral migration lengths. A 100% coverage is 
found for the growth at 150°C, corroborated by morphological observations in Fig 2. 
(d) and (h).

nm. As for the case of higher pillar densities, again InAs pyramids with edges oriented 
along the < 11̅0 > directions at their bases are observed to grow around GaAs pillars 
(Fig. 5). These InAs structures are distinct from hillocks formed on monolayer patterned 
areas in the sense that they show well-defined edges, three major and six minor facets 
as shown schematically in Fig. 6 (d). Facets are particularly well visible on samples 
grown at temperatures of 350qC and 300qC (Fig. 5 a,b). In case of the 300°C highgrowth rate sample R2, the pyramid edges appear to be rounded (Fig. 5c). Sample R2 
also shows on closer observation the presence of flat InAs islands surrounding the 
pyramids. Such islands are a result of the high nucleation rate and this should slightly 
reduce the volume of the InAs pyramids due to fewer adatoms available. In conjunction 
with higher pyramid sidewall inclination (shown below), this also prevents adjacent 
InAs pyramids from coalescing with one another as observed in case of R1 and T2 
(Fig. 5 (a), (b)). At 150°C (sample T1) InAs growth occurs in a very irregular way (Fig. 
5 (d)). Pillars are surrounded by numerous irregularly shaped InAs islands. On top of 
the pillars the formation of InAs nano-islands is observed (Fig. 5 (d)), similar as for the 
growth on larger diameter pillars with higher density in section 3.1 (Fig. 2 (d), (h)). Such 
a result is promising for the formation of InAs nano-islands on smaller diameter pillars 
at well-defined substrate positions 
AFM surface profiles of the pillars were analyzed quantitatively to index the facets 
formed on the pyramid surfaces (Fig. 6 (a), (b)). A typical AFM height profile of a major 
facet corresponding to a pyramid formed at 350°C (sample T2) is shown in Fig. 6 (c). 
AFM height profiles of the major facets along the < 112̅ > directions yield facet 
inclination angles of 35.5r1.4q, 36.2r1.7q and 38.9r1.7q for samples T2, R1 and R2 
respectively. The measured angles of samples T2 and R1 are close to the theoretical 
value of 35.26q between the ¢110² facet normals and the [111] plane normal of the 

===== Page 14 =====

14 
 
substrate. The same low energy {110} facet orientation has also been reported in the 
literature for InAs and GaAs grown on GaAs(111)A surfaces [22, 23, 24]. The higher 
growth rate sample R2 displays a larger facet inclination angle than samples T2 and 
R1, which can be ascribed to the enhanced second-layer nucleation rate and 3D like 
growth for higher group III flux and lower V/III ratio [17]. 
For the minor facets, inclination angle measurements with respect to the substrate 
surface yield values of 31.2qr1.8q and 39.6qr1.8q with respect to the substrate normal. 
However, since the intercepts line of the minor facets with the substrate show a wide 
range of variability (Fig. 5 (b), Fig. 6 (b)) the facet normals cannot be unequivocally 
assigned.   
Pyramid morphologies of samples T2 and T2’ with identical growth temperature but 
different In deposition angles are identical as shown in Supplementary Data file (Fig. 
S1 (a), section S1.). Models based on bulk atomic configurations at step edges are 
used to explain the pyramidal morphology of deposited materials during epitaxial 
growth. Despite neglecting any surface reconstructions, these models are able to 
explain the formation of pyramids on fcc (111) surfaces [24-26]. There are six < 112̅ > 
type directions lying in the GaAs(111)A plane, which are normal to the step edges 
parallel to < 11̅0 > directions. Among these six, three ([21̅1̅], [1̅1̅2] and [1̅21̅]) are of 
A type and three ([112̅], [12̅1] and [2̅11]) are B type step edges. Type A step edges 
are characterized by two dangling bonds per edge atom whereas it is only one in case 
of type B type step edges. This asymmetry results in a preference of arriving adatoms 
to be incorporated in type A step edges. This ultimately leads to faster growth and 
shrinking of type A step edges, resulting in the formation of a triangular base of the 
pyramids. As this basis is identical for each pyramid, the pyramids all show the same 
orientation.

Facet analysis of the InAs pyramids shows that the three major facets are of {110} 
type, each two of them are separated by two minor facets, which are likely to 
correspond to higher index planes due to their smaller projected area [27] compared 
to the major facets. The formation of such pyramidal structures with major and minor 
facets is a result of the system adopting an energetically favorable configuration under 
non-equilibrium processing conditions such as the MBE growth [28]. Another general 
observation of InAs growth on double layer patterned areas is the reduced lateral

coalescence of the hillocks due to the larger separation of the pillar bases. This also 
shows that the pyramids are the preferred shape in the absence of coalescence with 
adjacent growth fronts of neighboring InAs hillocks. 
 
4. Conclusions  
 
The growth morphology resulting from heteroepitaxial growth on nanopatterned 
substrates can be tailored by adjusting adatom mobility and spatial distribution of 
adatom sinks. In the present study, we have identified growth conditions which enable 
the formation of InAs quantum dots on GaAs (111)A pillar tops by a Stranski-Krastanov 
type growth mechanism and ring-like nanostructures at pillar bases by tuning adatom 
mobility. Formation of well-defined pyramidal InAs structures at pillar bases shows the

The intensity profile measured in the region of interest marked in Fig. S2-1 (b) in 
orange color is plotted in Fig. S2-1 (c). The intensity plot in Fig. S2-1 (c) shows 
enhanced intensity in the locations between the red arrows, also marked by red 
arrows in Fig. S2-1 (b). The enhanced intensity indicates that an InAs wetting layer is 
present since the intensity of HAADF-STEM intensities increase proportional to the 
projected atomic number Z~1.8 of the scattering atoms. Note the presence of 
amorphous material on top of the GaAs pillar, most likely due to contamination or 
oxidation.

HAADF-STEM measurements performed on a GaAs nano pillar after InAs growth 
corresponding to sample T2’ is shown in Fig. S2-2(a), together with an EDS (energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) line scan (Fig. S2-2(b)) along the dotted yellow line in 
Fig. S2-2(a). The elemental distribution of Indium, Gallium and Arsenic along the line 
are depicted. The spike in the Indium concentration at the edges of the pillar as seen 
in Fig. S2-2 (b) is an indication of an Indium rich layer on top of GaAs pillar. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The evidences presented in Fig. S2-1 and S2-2 are proof for the presence of an InAs 
wetting layer for all growth temperatures considered in this work.

S3. Steps involved in determination of InAs area coverage  
 
The sequence of operations performed in the estimation of InAs coverage on nanopillar patterned substrates is shown in Fig. S3. These operations yield a binary 
image, from which the area fraction is estimated by image analysis software, ImageJ.
