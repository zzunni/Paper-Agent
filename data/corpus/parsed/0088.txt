Over the past several years, the inherent scaling limitations of electron devices have 
fueled the exploration of high carrier mobility semiconductors as a Si replacement to 
further enhance the device performance1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. In particular, compound semiconductors 
heterogeneously integrated on Si substrates have been actively studied7,9,10, combining the 
high mobility of III-V semiconductors and the well-established, low cost processing of Si 
technology. This integration, however, presents significant challenges. Conventionally, 
heteroepitaxial growth of complex multilayers on Si has been explored9,11,12,13. Besides 
complexity, high defect densities and junction leakage currents present limitations in the

approach. Motivated by this challenge, here we utilize an epitaxial transfer method for the 
integration of ultrathin layers of single-crystalline InAs on Si/SiO2 substrates. As a parallel 
to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology14, we use the abbreviation “XOI” to represent our 
compound semiconductor-on-insulator platform. Through experiments and simulation, the 
electrical properties of InAs XOI transistors are explored, elucidating the critical role of 
quantum confinement in the transport properties of ultrathin XOI layers. Importantly, a 
high quality InAs/dielectric interface is obtained by the use of a novel thermally grown 
interfacial InAsOx layer (~1 nm thick).  The fabricated FETs exhibit an impressive peak 
transconductance of ~1.6 mS/µm at VDS=0.5V with ON/OFF current ratio of greater than 
10,000 and a subthreshold swing of 107-150 mV/decade for a channel length of ~0.5 µm. 
Epitaxial lift-off and transfer of crystalline microstructures to various support substrates 
has been shown to be a versatile technique for applications ranging from optoelectronics to largearea electronics15,16,17,18. Specifically, high performance, mechanically flexible macro-electronics 
and photovoltaics have been demonstrated on plastics, rubbers, and glass substrates by this 
method19,20,21. Here, we use a modified epitaxial transfer scheme for integrating ultrathin InAs 
layers with nanometer-scale thicknesses on Si/SiO2 substrates for use as high performance 
nanoscale transistors. The nanoscale thick InAs layers are fully depleted which is an important 
criteria for achieving high performance FETs with respectable OFF currents based on small band 
gap semiconductors. The transfer is achieved without the use of adhesive layers, thereby 
allowing for purely inorganic interfaces with low interface trap densities and high stability. The 
process schematic for the fabrication of InAs XOI substrates is shown in Figure 1a (see Methods 
for the details).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilized to characterize the surface morphology and 
uniformity of the fabricated XOI substrates. Figures 1b-c show representative AFM images of an 
array of InAs NRs (~18 nm thick) on a Si/SiO2 substrate, clearly depicting the smooth surfaces 
(< 1 nm surface roughness) and high uniformity of the enabled structures over large areas. 
Uniquely, the process readily enables the heterogeneous integration of different III-V materials 
and structures on a single substrate through a multi-step epitaxial transfer process. To 
demonstrate this capability, a two-step transfer process was utilized to form ordered arrays of 18 
and 48 nm thick InAs NRs that are perpendicularly oriented on the surface of a Si/SiO2 substrate 
(Figs. 1d-e). This result demonstrates the potential ability of the proposed XOI technology for 
generic heterogeneous and/or hierarchical assembly of crystalline semiconducting materials. In 
the future, a similar scheme may be utilized to enable the fabrication of both p- and n- type 
transistors on the same chip for complementary electronics based on the optimal III-V 
semiconductors. 
To shed light on the atomic structure of the interfaces, cross-sectional transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) images of an InAs XOI device were taken and are shown in Figure 2. 
The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2c) illustrates the single-crystalline structure of 
InAs NRs (~13 nm thick) with atomically abrupt interfaces with the SiO2 and ZrO2 layers. The 
TEM image of the InAs/SiO2 interface does not exhibit visible voids (Fig. 2c), although only a 
small fraction of the interface is examined by TEM. As described in more depth later in this 
paper, InAs NRs were thermally oxidized prior to the top-gate stack deposition to drastically 
lower the interfacial trap densities. The thermally grown InAsOx layer is clearly evident in the 
HRTEM image (Fig. 2c) with a thickness of ~1 nm.

Long-channel, back-gated field-effect transistors (FETs) based on individual NRs were 
fabricated in order to elucidate the intrinsic electron transport properties of InAs NRs as a 
function of thickness. The process scheme involved the fabrication of XOI substrates with the 
desired InAs thickness followed by the formation of source/drain (S/D) metal contacts by 
lithography and lift-off (~50 nm thick Ni). The p+ Si support substrate was used as the global 
back-gate with a 50 nm thermal SiO2 as the gate dielectric. Ni contacts were annealed at 225ºC 
for 5 min in a N2 ambient to enable the formation of low resistance contacts to the conduction 
band of InAs (Fig. S6) 22. The transfer characteristics at VDS=0.1V of the back-gated XOI FETs 
with a channel length, L~5 µm and InAs thicknesses of 8-48 nm are shown in Figure 3a. Two 
trends are clearly evident from the measurements. First, the OFF current monotonically increases 
with increasing thickness due to the reduced electrostatic gate coupling of the back-gate. Second, 
the ON current increases with InAs thickness due to the thickness dependency of electron 
mobility, μn. Since L~ 5µm, the devices are effectively operating in the diffusive regime, thereby, 
enabling the direct extraction of the field-effect mobility by using the relation μn,FE = 
(gm)(L2/CoxVDS), where

is the transconductance and Cox is the gate oxide 
capacitance (Fig. S5). For this analysis, parasitic resistances were ignored since Ni forms near 
ohmic metal contacts22. The gate oxide capacitance was estimated from the parallel plate 
capacitor model Cox = (εA)/d, where ε=3.9 and d=50 nm are the dielectric constant and thickness 
of SiO2, respectively. The effect of quantum capacitance, CQ was neglected due to the relatively 
thick gate dielectrics used in this study (i.e., Cox<<CQ). Figure 3b shows the peak μn,FE as a 
function of InAs thickness, TInAs. The mobility at first linearly increases with thickness for TInAs 
< ~18 nm with a slope of ~221 (cm2/Vs)/nm, beyond which it nearly saturates at μn,FE ~5,500

cm2/Vs. The measured XOI field-effect mobility is close to the reported Hall mobilities for 
InGaAs (~10,000 cm2/Vs)10 and InAs (13,200 cm2/Vs) 23 quantum well (QW) structures. It 
should be noted that the Hall mobility is typically higher than the field-effect mobility for any 
given material as a number of device and surface state contributions to carrier transport are not 
accounted in the Hall effect measurements.   
To shed light on the observed mobility trend, the low-field phonon mobility, μn,phonon was 
calculated as μn,phonon =

where f0 is the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution function. τ(E) was calculated using Fermi’s 
golden rule, with the matrix elements of the scattering potentials evaluated in the basis of the NR 
eigenfunctions. Both acoustic and optical (including polar) phonon scattering events were 
considered24. The calculated μn,phonon vs. TInAs is shown in Fig. 3b. For small thicknesses, the 
mobility linearly increases with the thickness. This behavior is attributed to the gradual transition 
of the channel from a 2D to 3D system as the NR thickness is increased, with more transport 
modes (i.e., sub-bands) contributing to the current flow. As the thickness surpasses the Bohr 
radius of bulk InAs (~34 nm), the electronic structure of NRs approaches the 3D regime, 
resulting in a mobility saturation for TInAs>~35 nm to the well-known bulk value of InAs 
(~40,000 cm2/Vs)25.  While the onset thickness of saturation closely matches the experiments, 
there is 5-10× discrepancy in the actual mobility values. This is expected since the extracted data 
represents the field-effect mobility, consisting of phonon scattering along with other device

contributions, including interface trap states, surface roughness scattering, and vertical-fieldinduced mobility degradation. Both surface roughness and vertical-field (i.e., gate field) induce 
additional carrier scattering events at the surface/interface, while the primary effect of interface 
trap states is to deteriorate the modulating the channel conductance (i.e., charge density) by the 
gate-field. These effects degrade the extracted gm and thereby μn,FE. To simulate μn,FE, a full 
device simulation was performed (see Supp. Info.). An interface trap density, Dit= 6×1012 states 
cm−2eV−1 was used as the fitting parameter. The simulated I-V characteristics of XOI back-gated 
FETs are shown in Figure 3a. Clearly, the simulated I-V curves match the experimental data 
closely for all InAs thicknesses, especially in the ON-state. Next, peak μn,FE was extracted from 
simulation and plotted as a function of TInAs (Fig. 3b), once again closely matching the 
experimental μn,FE. The close matching of the experimental and simulated results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the XOI platform as a clean and predictable material system for exploring high 
performance devices while highlighting the critical role of quantum confinement and surface 
contributions on the transport properties of InAs, even at relatively large thicknesses. It should be 
noted that since the ribbon width used in this work is 10~30 times larger than the thickness, there 
is minimal dependence of the device performance on the NR width (Fig. S13), thereby, the 
structures can be effectively treated as thin films. 
In order to explore the performance limits of InAs XOI devices, top-gated FETs with 
high-κ gate dielectrics and L~0.5 µm were fabricated. Briefly, Ni S/D contacts were 
lithographically patterned on InAs NRs followed by the atomic layer deposition of ~8 nm thick 
ZrO2 (ε ~ 20) as the gate dielectric. A local top-gate (Ni, 50 nm thick), underlapping the S/D 
electrodes by ~100 nm was then lithographically patterned. Importantly, thermal oxidation of 
InAs was found to significantly improve the interfacial properties and FET characteristics (Fig.

S8). In this regard, prior to the S/D contact formation, the XOI substrates were first treated with 
3% NH4OH to remove the native oxide followed by the thermal oxidation at 350ºC for 1 min to 
form ~1 nm thick InAsOx layer as observed from TEM analysis (Fig. 2c). Figure 4a shows a 
typical IDS-VGS characteristic of a top-gated FET, consisting of an individual ~18 nm thick InAs 
NR with a width of ~320 nm. The XOI FET exhibits a respectable ION/IOFF~104, a subthreshold 
swing of SS=dVGS/d(logIDS) ~ 150 mV/decade (Fig. 4a), and a peak gm ~ 1.6 mS/µm at VDS=0.5V 
(Fig. S9). The lowest measured SS for our XOI FETs is ~107 mV/decade (Fig. S10) as compared 
to InAs and InGaAs QW-FETs in literature which have exhibited SS ~ 70 and 75 mV/dec, 
respectively 10,23. The devices reported here use a relatively thick gate dielectric which can be 
scaled down in the future to further improve the gate electrostatic control and the SS 
characteristics. The single NR transistor output characteristic is shown in Fig. 4b, delivering an 
impressive ION~1.4 mA/µm at an operating voltage, VDD=VDS=VGS=1V. To further analyze the 
performance, a full device simulation was performed.  A close match of the experimental data is 
obtained with Dit=1011 states cm−2eV−1 used as the fitting parameter (see Supp. Info., Fig. S7), 
which is a ~60× improvement over devices without any surface treatment (i.e., with a native 
oxide layer). The fitted Dit values represent only estimation. Note that while C-V measurement is 
conventionally utilized for Dit extraction in Si devices, doing so is rather challenging and prone 
to a large uncertainty for narrow bandgap semiconductors, such as InAs26. In the future, the 
development of more accurate techniques for Dit measurement in InAs XOI devices is needed. 
The explored thermal oxidation process for surface passivation is counter-intuitive as the 
previous works have focused on the removal of surface oxides7. We speculate that unlike the 
native oxide layer, thermal oxidation results in the formation of a dense oxide with minimal

dangling bonds. Similar to the thermally grown SiO2, the thermal oxide of InAs provides an ideal 
and simple surface passivation layer, addressing one of the important challenges in InAs devices.  
In conclusion, a new technology platform and device concept for the integration of 
ultrathin layers of III-V semiconductors directly on Si substrates is demonstrated, enabling 
excellent electronic device performances. While in this work we focus on InAs as the active 
channel material, in the future, other compound semiconductors could be explored using a 
similar scheme. In the future, research on the scalability of the process for 8” and 12” wafer 
processing is needed.  We envision that wafer bonding of Si/SiO2 and III-V wafers followed by 
the etch release of the sacrificial layer may be utilized to enable a manufacturable process 
scheme for ultrathin XOI devices.

Methods summary 
Single-crystalline InAs thin films (10-100 nm thick) were grown epitaxially on a 60 nm thick 
Al0.2Ga0.8Sb layer on bulk GaSb substrates (see Supp. Info., Fig. S1). Polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA) patterns with a pitch and line-width of ~840 nm and ~350 nm, respectively, were 
lithographically patterned on the surface of the source substrate. The InAs layer was then pattern 
etched into nanoribbons (NRs) by using a mixture of citric acid (1 g/ml of water) and hydrogen 
peroxide (30%) at 1:20 volume ratio, which was chosen for its high selectivity and low resulting 
InAs edge roughness27. To release the InAs NRs from the source substrate, the AlGaSb layer was 
selectively etched by ammonium hydroxide (3%, in water) solution for 110 min28. Note that the 
selective etching of the AlGaSb layer was high enough not to affect the nanoscale structure of 
the InAs NRs (see Supp. Info., Fig. S2). Next, an elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
substrate (~2 mm thick) was used to detach the partially released InAs NRs from the GaSb donor 
substrates and transfer them onto Si/SiO2 (50 nm, thermally grown) receiver substrates by a 
stamping process (Fig. S3-S4) 29. Notably, in this process scheme, the initial epitaxial growth 
process is used to control the thickness of the transferred InAs NRs, while the lithographically 
defined PMMA etch mask is used to tune the length and width.

Preparation of the GaSb/Al0.2Ga0.8Sb/InAs source wafers used for the epitaxial 
transfer process 
The source layers were grown in a solid source VG-80 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
reactor on n-type (Te-doped, 5×1017 cm-3) epi-ready GaSb (001) double-side polished substrates 
using As2 and Sb2 valved cracker sources. Indium and gallium growth rates were determined by 
monitoring the intensity oscillations in the reflected high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) 
patterns and set to 0.35 ML/s for Ga, 0.30 ML/s for In and 0.43 ML/s for AlGaSb. Group-V 
fluxes were adjusted using a conventional ion gauge to satisfy a group V/III beam equivalent 
pressure (BEP) flux ratio equal to 3.6 for GaSb and 9 for InAs.  Initially, the substrate was 
outgassed under a vacuum, and then the surface oxide was removed at high temperature (535 ºC) 
under an Sb flux. The GaSb and Al0.2Ga0.8Sb layers of the structure were grown at 490 ºC 
whereas the InAs layer was grown at 410 ºC. Cross-sectional TEM images of an as-grown source 
sample is shown Figure S1.

Selective wet etching of the AlGaSb sacrificial layer during the epitaxial transfer 
process 
To release the InAs NRs from the source substrate after the etching of InAs film into NRs, the 
underlying Al0.2Ga0.8Sb layer was selectively etched. Here, we used ammonium hydroxide (3%, 
in water) solution for the selective wet etching of the Al0.2Ga0.8Sb layer. Figure S2 shows the 
SEM images of InAs NRs on the source substrate after different NH4OH etching times (0, 10, 30, 
50 mins), clearly demonstrating the highly selective etching of the AlGaSb sacrificial layer.

Details of the epitaxial layer transfer 
Following the partial etch of the AlGaSb layer in ammonium hydroxide (3%, in water) 
solution for 110 min (for 350 nm wide NRs), an elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
substrate (~2 mm thick) was brought in contact with the source wafer. The PDMS stamp was 
used to detach the partially released InAs NRs from the source substrate followed by their 
transfer onto Si/SiO2 (50 nm, thermally grown) receiver substrates. The step by step transfer 
process is as followed. 
1. 10:1 ratio mixture of PDMS prepolymer and curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning 
Co., USA) was cured at 80 °C for 4-5 hrs. 
2. The cured PDMS slab was cleaned by dipping into toluene for ~30 min and dried 
completely on top of a hot plate for ~2-3 hrs. 
3. The cleaned PDMS slab (~2 mm thick) was pressed (10–200 N/cm2, ~10 sec) on top of 
the partially released InAs NRs on the source substrate. 
4. The PDMS slab was gently detached from the source substrate, resulting in the transfer of 
InAs NRs from the source wafer to the PDMS slab. 
5. The PDMS slab with InAs NRs was dipped in 50:1 HF for 1 min to remove any residues 
of the sacrificial layer on the surface of InAs NRs. 
6. InAs NRs were transferred by pressing (10–200 N/cm2, ~10 sec) the PDMS slab on a 
Si/SiO2 receiver substrate in ambient laboratory condition (e.g. room temperature and air 
environment). Before the transfer of InAs NRs, the receiver substrate was cleaned by 
acetone, IPA, and DI water.  
7. The PDMS slab was gently removed from the Si/SiO2 substrate, leaving behind the InAs 
NRs. 
Figure S3 shows the SEM images of the source substrate before and after the transfer by a 
PDMS stamp. The results show that InAs NRs are cleanly cleaved from the source wafer.

3% NH4OH etch) and before the transfer step. b, SEM image of the source substrate after the 
transfer process, showing pyramidal AlGaSb posts. 
 
During the transfer process, residues from the AlGaSb sacrificial layer may remain on the 
back surface of InAs NRs.  To remove any potential residues on the backside, the PDMS slab 
with InAs NRs was dipped in 50:1 HF for 1 min.  From the AFM analysis (Fig. S4), InAs NRs 
exhibit clean surfaces after the HF treatment, which is critical for making a conformal contact 
during the subsequent transfer to the Si/SiO2 substrate.  To perform AFM analysis of the back 
side of InAs NRs, a two-step PDMS transfer process was used in which InAs NRs on a PDMS 
slab were first transferred to a second PDMS slab before getting transferred to a Si/SiO2 
substrate. This results in InAs XOI substrates with the original back surface (i.e., on the source 
wafer) now being on the top.  The effect of HF cleaning is clearly depicted in Fig. S4b.

Field-effect mobility of long-channel, back-gated XOI FETs based on individual 
InAs NRs  
The transconductance (gm = dIDS/dVGS|VDS) as a function of VGS for back-gated InAs XOI FETs, 
consisting of individual NRs, was first obtained from the measured transfer characteristics at 
VDS=0.1V. The field-effect electron mobility was then estimated from the relation μn,FE = 
(gm)(L2/CoxVDS), where L is the channel length and Cox is the gate oxide capacitance. Fig. S5 
shows the extracted field-effect electron mobility as a function of VGS for representative XOI 
FETs with InAs NR thickness of 8, 13, and 48 nm. The peak field-effect mobility increases with 
the thickness of InAs as depicted in Figure 3b of the main text. It is also evident from the μn,FE - 
VGS plots that the field-effect mobility increases with the gate voltage at first and then decreases 
at high gate voltages due to the enhanced surface scattering of electrons at high electric fields, 
similar to the conventional MOSFETs.

Calculation of phonon mobility of InAs NRs 
This section outlines the calculation of low-field mobility of InAs NRs by considering various 
phonon scattering mechanisms. As the NRs are not intentionally doped, we assume an electron 
concentration n~ 1015 cm-3 arising due to unintentional doping. The density of states of NRs can 
be approximated by 
  
m*
πh2TInAs
, where TInAs is the NR thickness. Since this density of states is 
much larger than n, it is reasonable to assume that the equilibrium Fermi energy EF lies within 
the bandgap for all values of TInAs. Hence, the peak mobility measured in experiments 
corresponds to the maximum transconductance gm, which occurs when EF coincides with the first 
conduction sub-band in the channel. We consider the contribution of acoustic and optical 
phonons along with polar optical phonons - the dominant source of scattering in polar 
semiconductors like InAs. The scattering rate due to acoustic and optical phonons is summed 
over longitudinal and transverse modes. The energy dependent scattering rate is averaged over 
the range of a few kBT around EF.

effective mass etc. in the dispersion relation of InAs NRs1,2.  Three approximations are used for 
the calculations. i) The parabolic band approximation was used for the estimation of the 
conduction band density of states. This is justified due to the fact that we are interested in the 
peak mobility that arises at the onset of threshold where the Fermi level is near the bottom edge 
of the conduction band. For both bulk and thin InAs NRs, the bottom of the conduction band 
along the direction of transport (100) is largely parabolic. ii) 3D (i.e., bulk) phonon modes were 
used for all thicknesses3. iii) Finally, interband scattering was ignored for simplicity.  
 
The rate for each of the scattering mechanisms is calculated using the Fermi’s golden rule 
wherein the matrix elements of each of the scattering potentials are evaluated in the basis of 
eigenfunctions of the NR4.

τ pop(E)is the polar optical phonon scattering rate,  ωLOis the longitudinal optical phonon 
frequency, κ0 and κ∞are the static and high frequency permitivities respectively.  It must be 
noted that the polar optical phonon scattering rate, owing to the nature of the scattering potential, 
does not depend explicitly on TInAs unlike the other two scattering mechanisms and the 
dependence comes through m*.  
 
The calculated mobility vs. thickness is shown in Fig. 3(b) by the solid black curve. For 
small thicknesses the mobility increases almost linearly with thickness. This is due to the fact 
that with increasing thickness more modes start to creep into the energy window that contributes 
to the current flow. As the thickness increases, the additional increase in the number of modes 
starts to saturate and beyond a threshold point, the mobility saturates to the well known bulk 
value of InAs8.  
 
From the measured field-effect and calculated phonon mobilities as a function of TInAs 
(Fig. 3b), the following observations can be made. First, the calculated value of µn,phonon for large 
values of TInAs (i.e., ~50 nm) is close to the bulk Hall mobility of InAs reported in the literature8 
thus ascertaining that all the dominant scattering mechanisms are considered. Second, the drop in 
the measured value of field-effect mobility with thickness miniaturization, which signals the 
onset of confinement effects, occurs for TInAs=30-40 nm.  This critical thickness which is 
consistent with the experimental result is close to the Bohr radius of bulk InAs (~34 nm). 
Notably, the thickness where the system transitions from 3D to 2D depends strongly on m*. A 
quantitative agreement with experiments in this regard further validates the m* values calculated 
from InAs NR dispersion relations. It should be noted that in all the calculations, NRs are 
effectively treated as thin films, since the widths are large enough (>~300 nm) not to cause

confinement effects along the width of the NRs. Only the thickness affects the electronic 
properties. 
 
Device simulation of InAs XOI FETs  
The two dimensional simulations were carried out by self consistently solving Poisson’s 
Equation, the electron and hole drift diffusion equations using TCAD Sentaurus 2009. Both topgated and back-gated device structures were simulated. The back-gated FET consisted of a p-Si 
substrate with NA=1021 cm-3 used as the global gate with 50 nm of SiO2 (ε=3.9) gate dielectric. A 
2 nm thick indium oxide layer (ε=3.4) was assumed on the top and bottom surfaces. The channel 
length was assumed 5 µm, and the InAs thickness was varied from 5-50 nm. The InAs NR was 
assumed n-type with ND=4×1016 cm-3. This value was chosen to best match the experimental ON 
current for the devices. In addition, thin regions of heavily doped InAs were inserted between the 
contacts and the channel to minimize contact effects on the simulated data. Interface traps were 
placed at the InAs/Indium Oxide interfaces on both the top and bottom surfaces of NRs. The 
interface trap density was used as a fitting parameter with Dit = 6×1012 states eV-1-cm-2 was 
found to fit the experimental results the best for all NR thicknesses. The major contribution of Dit 
is reducing the efficiency of the gate-field in modulating the channel charge density. In addition, 
field-dependent mobility and velocity saturation models were both considered. The interface 
scattering was treated by using the vertical-field mobility degradation model of Sentaurus. This 
models the mobility degradation at the interface as a function of the vertical-field using 
calibrated parameters for conventional MOSFETs. A one-band effective-mass model was used 
which ignores the effect of quantum confinement on the density of states. In the future, a more 
accurate device simulation that incorporates the density of states as a function of quantization

and InAs thickness is needed. For each NR thickness, the calculated phonon mobility, confined 
bandgap, and confined effective mass were used as input parameters. Due to the weak gate 
coupling to the channel (arising from the back-gate geometry) and the high Dit, the current in the 
VGS = -0.5V to 0.5V region is not properly handled by Sentaurus. In order to provide for a 
smooth transition between the subthreshold and accumulation regimes, the simulated IDS-VGS 
curves were fit to an error function, with the points mentioned above removed. This allowed for 
a more accurate fitting for the region between the subthreshold and ON-state regimes. The 
threshold voltage of each simulated curve was shifted to match that of the corresponding 
experimental device. After fitting, the field-effect mobility was deduced as a function of the gate 
voltage from the simulated I-V characteristics by using the analytical expression described 
previously. The peak mobility was then extracted for each InAs thickness and plotted in Figure 
3b. Note that the 5-10x reduction of the field-effect mobility as compared to the calculated 
phonon mobility is expected due to the various device contributions, including vertical-field 
induced carrier scattering and Dit. As a parallel, for lightly doped Si, the measured mobility for 
an effective field of 1MV/cm is ~250 cm2/V-s, while, for the same doping, the sheet mobility is 
~1100 cm2/V-s 9,10. This behavior is similar to that observed in our InAs XOI FETs.  
 
 

===== Page 33 =====

S14 
 
Similarly, the top-gated XOI FETs were simulated with 2 nm of indium oxide assumed 
on the two surfaces of InAs with a body doping concentration of ND=4×1016 cm-3. The top gate 
stack was composed of 7 nm of ZrO2 (ε=20) and a metal gate electrode with a workfunction of 
5eV. The source and drain contacts were assumed ohmic. To fit the subthreshold swing of the 
experimental devices, the trap density at the InAs/InAsOx interfaces was chosen to be Dit=1011 
states eV-1-cm-2. Notably, this extracted Dit is ~60× lower than that of the back-gated FETs as 
the former consists of thermally grown InAsOx passivation layer while the latter consists of a 
native oxide layer. To fit the linear region, the series resistance at the source and drain (Rs, Rd) 
were chosen to be 100 Ω.µm (unit width normalized) as obtained from the length dependent 
transport studies (Fig. S6). The threshold voltage was shifted to match that of the corresponding 
experimental device. The simulation results are show in Figure S7, clearly depicting the close 
match between the experiment and simulation, further demonstrating the near ideal material and 
device system presented in this work with deterministic electrical properties. Note that this 
simulation is valid only for low to moderate gate overdrives where the Fermi level is near the 
conduction band edge.  Within this regime, the parabolic band approximation used in this work 
is valid.  In the future, a more accurate simulation of the XOI FETs with the proper band 
structure treatment and quantum confinement effects is needed.

Electrical properties of InAs XOI top-gated FETs as a function of surface/interface

(ii) without any surface treatment (i.e., consisting of ~ 1 nm native surface oxide layer) before 
ALD (red marks), and (iii) with NH4OH immediately prior to the ALD to remove the surface 
oxide layer (blue marks).  For the thermally oxidized sample, the native oxide was first removed 
by a treatment with 3% NH4OH. The results clearly depict the drastic enhancement of the 
subthreshold characteristics due to the effective surface passivation role of the thermally grown 
InAsOx layer, resulting in enhanced electrostatic coupling of the gate electrode. The SS is 107,

 at VDS=0.5 as a function of VGS obtained 
from the IDS-VGS data shown in Figure 4c.  The dashed gray line represents the obtained 
transconductance after current differentiation while the red line is after 2nd order Savitsky-Golay 
smoothing. 
The extrinsic transconductance, gm, extracted from the measurement (Fig. S9) includes 
the effect of series resistance. The intrinsic transconductance, gmi, can be extracted as gmi = 
gm/(1-gmRS -gdRSD)11, where RS is the source series resistance, RSD is the source and drain series 
resistance (i.e., RSD=RS+RD), and gd (=dIDS/dVDS) is the drain conductance.  Using this analysis, 
the peak gmi of the experimental device is ~2 mS/μm, assuming RS=RD=100 Ω.µm (Fig. S6) and 
gd ~ 0.23 mS/µm (at VGS=0.2V and VDS=0.5V; Fig. 4b). 
To analyze the transconductance, it is beneficial to look at the basic equation for drain 
current in a MOSFET, IDS = vdrift×n×q, where vdrift is the electron drift velocity, n is the electron 
density, and q is the charge of an electron. At low electric-fields, vdirft=µn×E, where E is the

electric field while at high fields, the velocity saturates at vsat. The electron density, n can be 
approximated as n=(Cox/L)×(VGS-Vt), where Vt is the threshold voltage and Cox is total gate 
capacitance. For long channel lengths and low electric-fields, gmi=µnCox(VGS-Vt)/L2 while 
gmi=vsat(Cox/L) in the high-field regime. Based on the velocity vs. field for bulk InAs from 
literature12, our experimental devices, with L~0.5µm and Vds=0.5 V, are operating closer to the 
high-field limit rather than the diffusive regime. Since Cox is the total capacitance, it is a linear 
function of the channel length, L, making gmi independent of L at high-fields. From the vdrift vs. 
electric-field curve12 for bulk InAs, at a field of 10 kV/cm (corresponding to VDS=0.5V and 
L=0.5 µm used in the experiments), the drift velocity is ~1.5 x 107 cm/s. For the presented device 
with Cox~2×10-15 F (tox~8 nm ZrO2, L=0.5 µm and width, W=320 nm), gmi ~ 0.61 mS is 
approximated by using the high-field analytical expression, corresponding to a unit-width 
normalized value of ~2 mS/μm.  This calculated value is close to that of the experimentally 
extracted value.  Note that this presents only a rough guideline since the bulk velocity vs. field 
curve was used in the calculation as that of an ultrathin InAs layer is not well established in the 
literature. When compared to InAs HEMTs in the literature, the transconductance of our FETs is 
comparable. The value of intrinsic transconductance for InAs quantum-well FETs (QWFETs) 
with 10 nm InAs thickness is reported to be ~3mS/  μm for L=40 - 200 nm, with minimal 
dependence on L for this explored range13.  This is expected since for such short channel lengths, 
the devices are operating in the high-field regime where the intrinsic transconductance shows 
minimal length dependence as noted above.   
At high gate fields (i.e., VGS>0.3V), the transconductance rapidly drops. This can be 
attributed to a combination of various factors which effectively cause a current saturation at high 
gate-fields.  These effects include (i) an increase in the electron effective mass and thereby a

reduction in the carrier velocity as the Fermi level is driven deep into the conduction band due to 
the band structure of InAs NRs, (ii) enhanced surface scattering of carriers at high vertical fields, 
similar to that of the conventional MOSFETs, and (iii) the inability of the metal source to supply 
enough charge due to the metal-semiconductor contacts as shown previously for thin-body, 
metal-contacted MOSFETs14. In the future, a more in-depth exploration of transport physics of 
careers is required to better elucidate the observed field-dependent behavior.

are similar to the devices made from 350nm wide InAs NRs, providing evidence that the width

few hundred nm (i.e., width >>thickness) which is the case in this work.
