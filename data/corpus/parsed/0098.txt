Abstract 
    Graphene’s unparalleled strength, chemical stability, ultimate surface-to-volume ratio and 
excellent electronic properties make it an ideal candidate as a material for membranes in micro- 
and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). However, the integration of graphene 
into MEMS or NEMS devices and suspended structures such as proof masses on graphene 
membranes raises several technological challenges, including collapse and rupture of the graphene. 
We have developed a robust route for realizing membranes made of double-layer CVD graphene 
and suspending large silicon proof masses on membranes with high yields. We have demonstrated 
the manufacture of square graphene membranes with side lengths from 7 µm to 110 µm and 
suspended 
proof 
masses 
consisting 
of 
solid 
silicon 
cubes 
that 
are 
from  
5 µm × 5 µm × 16.4 µm to 100 µm × 100 µm × 16.4 µm in size. Our approach is compatible with 
wafer-scale MEMS and semiconductor manufacturing technologies, and the manufacturing yields 
of the graphene membranes with suspended proof masses were greater than 90%, with more than 
70% of the graphene membranes having more than 90% graphene area without visible defects. The 
measured resonance frequencies of the realized structures ranged from tens to hundreds of kHz, 
with quality factors ranging from 63 to 148. The graphene membranes with suspended proof 
masses were extremely robust and were able to withstand indentation forces from an atomic force 
microscope (AFM) tip of up to ~7000 nN. The proposed approach for the reliable and large-scale 
manufacture of graphene membranes with suspended proof masses will enable the development 
and study of innovative NEMS devices with new functionalities and improved performances.

Introduction 
    The atomically thin structure of graphene (atom-layer distance of ~0.335 nm) and its remarkable 
mechanical1 and electrical properties2 (Young’s modulus of up to ~1 TPa and charge carrier 
mobility of up to 200,000 cm2 V −1 s−1) make it a very promising membrane and transducer 
material for micro- and nanoelectromechanical system (MEMS & NEMS) applications3–9. 
However, the application of suspended graphene in NEMS devices has thus far been limited to 
resonators10–19, pressure sensors20–25, switches7,26–28, loudspeakers29, microphones30,31 and devices 
for fundamental studies of the material and structural properties of graphene8,32–37. The reported 
suspended graphene structures include doubly clamped graphene beams, fully clamped graphene 
drums and suspended graphene-based cantilevers. Suspended structures are typically realized by 
transferring graphene from the original substrate to a pre-fabricated substrate with trenches11,15, 
cavities12,20 or membranes made of dielectric layers21,38,38,39 or by transferring graphene from the 
original substrate to a flat silicon dioxide (SiO2)16,17,40–42 or polymer substrate surface43,44 and then 
removing parts of the material underneath the graphene by sacrificial etching. 
 
    In contrast to previously reported graphene membranes and beams, MEMS and NEMS devices 
such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and resonators often employ larger proof masses (e.g., ~107 to 
~1010 µm3 in size) that are suspended on springs in the form of membranes, beams or cantilevers. 
Graphene, as a robust and intrinsically nanoscale material, could be used to suspend large proof 
masses, thereby forming spring-mass systems consisting of atomically thin graphene springs for 
potential applications as ultra-miniaturized transducer elements in future high-performance NEMS 
devices 20. However, the realization of suspended graphene with large attached proof masses is 
difficult, and to the best of our knowledge, no such examples have been reported in the literature.

A previous report of suspended graphene membranes with very small masses included micrometresized few-layer graphene cantilevers with diamond allotrope carbon masses (0.5 µm in length, 1.5 
µm in width and 20 nm in thickness, with a corresponding weight of 5.7 × 10-14 g) fabricated using 
focused ion beam (FIB) deposition for the study of the mechanical properties of graphene45. 
Previous literature also reports a spiral spring, a kirigami pyramid and a variety of cantilevers based 
on a suspended graphene monolayer supporting 50 nm thick gold masses attached to suspended 
cantilevers46. However, these structures had to be kept in a liquid to maintain their mechanical 
integrity. Suspended graphene membranes with diameters of 3-10 µm that were circularly clamped 
by a polymer (SU-8) and that supported a mass made of either SU-8 or gold located at the centre 
of the membrane were reported for shock detection caused by ultra-high mechanical impacts47. 
However, all previous reports involved extremely small masses, and the fabrication methods 
employed, such as FIB-induced deposition, were slow and typically not compatible with largescale manufacturing. 
 
In this paper, we present a robust, scalable and high-yield manufacturing approach to realize 
CVD graphene membranes with large suspended silicon (Si) proof masses that is compatible with 
MEMS and NEMS manufacturing processes and that can be utilized for devising NEMS with 
graphene membranes as structural and functional components. Our approach employs a silicon-oninsulator (SOI) substrate to form silicon proof masses that are etched in the silicon device layer of 
the SOI wafer. The graphene membranes are formed by transferring a double layer of CVD 
graphene to the pre-patterned SOI wafer, followed by a combination of dry etching and vapour HF 
etching of the buried oxide (BOX) layer to release the silicon proof masses and suspend them on 
the graphene membranes. Static and dynamic mechanical characterization of the manufactured

structures shows that they are robust and can potentially be used as spring-mass systems in future 
ultra-small NEMS such as resonators and accelerometers. 
 
Results 
    To demonstrate the feasibility of graphene membranes with large suspended proof masses, we 
fabricated square membranes with different dimensions made of double-layer graphene on which 
silicon proof masses of different sizes were suspended. A typical device structure is illustrated in 
Fig. 1a-e. Our fabrication approach utilizes an SOI wafer where the silicon proof mass is formed 
in the device layer of the SOI wafer by dry etching, followed by transfer of double-layer graphene 
to the SOI wafer and release of the proof mass by sacrificially removing the BOX layer using dry 
etching in combination with vapour HF etching. A schematic of the fabrication and integration 
process is shown in Fig. 1f-i, and three-dimensional (3D) and cross-sectional views of the structure 
at key process steps are shown in Fig. 2 (see Methods section for details). Scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) images of typical graphene membrane structures with suspended silicon proof 
masses are shown in Fig. 3. The process scheme of patterning the SOI substrate prior to graphene 
transfer reduces the processing steps after graphene transfer, which improves the cleanliness and 
purity of the graphene and reduces the risk of rupturing or destroying the membranes during 
processing. Each layer of the SOI substrate has a specialized function: the device layer is used for 
fabricating trenches and defining the proof masses, the handle substrate is used as a support, and 
the BOX layer is used as a sacrificial layer to gently release the mass. In our demonstration, we 
have chosen SOI wafers with thicknesses of the silicon device layer, the BOX layer and the handle 
layer of 15 µm, 2 µm, and 400 µm, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1c. Here, the thickness of the 
silicon device layer was chosen to form proof masses with reasonable aspect ratios but can in 
principle be adapted to specific application requirements.

mass suspended on a graphene membrane consisted of a square cuboid measuring  
5 µm × 5 µm × 16.4 µm, and the largest mass consisted of a square cuboid measuring  
100 µm × 100 µm × 16.4 µm. The trench depth was 16.4 µm, which is identical to the thickness of 
the silicon mass, consisting of a 15 µm thick silicon device layer and a 1.4 µm thick SiO2 layer 
(Fig. 1c and e). The calculated weight of a 100 µm × 100 µm × 15 µm silicon proof mass covered 
by a 1.4 µm thick layer of SiO2 is 3.86 × 10-7 g, where the SiO2 and the silicon densities are 2.65 
× 103 kg/m3 and 2.329× 103 kg/m3, respectively. The side length and depth of the open space 
formed by backside etching of the handle substrate of the SOI wafer are 150 µm × 150 µm and 400 
µm, respectively (Fig. 1d and e). From Table 1, it can be seen that the weight of this proof mass is 
three orders of magnitude larger than the SU-8 mass, six orders of magnitude larger than the gold 
mass and seven orders of magnitude larger than the carbon mass that have been reported previously, 
respectively45–47. The dramatically increased weight of the suspended proof mass is potentially of 
interest for applications such as miniaturized NEMS inertial sensors. 
 
SEM images of different graphene membranes with suspended proof masses are shown in Fig. 
3a-c and Fig. 3d and e, with the structure in Fig. 3a-c being free of holes in the suspended graphene 
membrane and the structure in Fig. 3d and e featuring a hole in the graphene membrane. To 
demonstrate the complete release of the proof mass, SEM characterization of the backside of the 
SOI chips was performed (Fig. 3 f and g). From these SEM images, it can be seen that the BOX 
layer was completely removed, which means that our fabricated proof masses are suspended and 
only attached to the graphene membranes. The strong attachment of the SiO2/Si proof mass to the 
graphene membrane is due to the large adhesion energy between the graphene and the SiO2 surface 
of the proof mass that is caused by van der Waals forces48,49. Extremely strong adhesion of

graphene to SiO2 surfaces by van der Waals interactions has been previously demonstrated by 
experiments, analytical models and atomistic simulations49,50. 
 
To verify that double-layer graphene indeed exists in our fabricated structures, we performed 
Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 4a shows the Raman spectra of double-layer graphene at three different 
positions (Fig. 4b) of a manufactured structure with 4 µm wide trenches and a 50 µm × 50 µm × 
16.4 µm proof mass. The Raman spectra show the typical characteristic peaks of graphene: The “G 
peaks” at approximately 1600 cm-1 (Fig. 4c) and the “2D peaks” at approximately 2700 cm-1 (Fig. 
4d) 51,52 demonstrate the presence of graphene, and the absence of an appreciable D peak (1350 
cm-1) in the Raman spectra indicates the relatively high quality of the graphene. The shape of the 
2D band in Fig. 4d indicates the presence of double-layer graphene. The second-order Raman 2D 
band caused by a two-phonon lattice vibrational process is sensitive to the number of layers of 
graphene, and the 2D band of monolayer graphene is very sharp and symmetric53. For double-layer 
and multi-layer graphene, the 2D band becomes much broader, as shown in Fig. 4, mainly due to 
the change in the electronic structure of the graphene53.

    To characterize the dynamic mechanical properties of the spring-mass system of our structures, 
we determined the resonance frequencies of four structures in vacuum (using a vacuum chamber 
with 10-5 mbar actively pumped vacuum) by measuring the amplitude of their thermomechanical 
noise using laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) (Fig. 5, Figure S1 and Figure S2 in the Supporting 
Information, and Methods). Fig. 5a-d shows the LDV measurements of four structures (Fig. 5e-h) 
that have identical trench widths (3 µm) but different proof mass dimensions (25 µm × 25 µm × 
16.4 µm; 30 µm × 30 µm × 16.4 µm; 40 µm × 40 µm × 16.4 µm and 50 µm × 50 µm × 16.4 µm, 
Fig. 5e-h). The resonance frequencies of these devices are ~158 kHz (Fig. 5a), ~90 kHz (Fig. 5b), 
~78.8 kHz (Fig. 5c), and ~60.3 kHz (Fig. 5d). As expected, the resonance frequency decreases with 
an increase in the weight of the suspended proof mass (Fig. 5a-d). The corresponding quality factor 
(Q) of one of the structures (Fig. 5g) is estimated by using a Lorentz fitting to their resonance 
frequencies of approximately 63 (Fig. 5c). The Q factor is comparable to those reported in previous 
studies10,11,13,15,40,54. Since these measurements were performed in vacuum, we can claim that the 
Q-factors of our structures are likely dominated by energy losses in the mechanical structure itself, 
such as losses from internal friction in the double-layer graphene membranes, clamping losses, 
surface losses, and thermoelastic damping55–57.

with attached proof mass of the four measured devices in (a), (b), (c) and (d), respectively. The

To further confirm the frequency response of the spring-mass system of our structures, we used 
LDV to measure the frequency response of a device with a trench width of 3 µm and proof mass 
dimensions of 50 µm × 50 µm × 16.4 µm in air (atmospheric pressure) at room temperature by 
driving the device with a piezoshaker (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a displays the amplitude and phase response 
as a function of frequency. The resonance frequency (88.1 kHz) of the device is of the same order 
as those found using thermomechanical noise measurements (Fig. 5). The corresponding Q factor 
of the structure (Fig. 6c) was estimated by using a Lorentz fit to be approximately 148 (Fig. 6b), 
which is comparable to those based on thermomechanical noise measurements (Fig. 5). Since our 
graphene membranes and proof masses are not located close to a surface in the direction of the 
movement of the membrane, we do not expect squeeze-film damping when the structure is operated 
in gas at atmospheric pressure. The measured value of Q in air confirms our hypothesis.

    To characterize the static mechanical properties and robustness of our graphene structures, we 
performed force-displacement measurements using AFM tip indentation at the centre of a

µm × 16.4 µm (Fig. 7a, b and c). As shown in Fig. 7b, when the AFM indentation force gradually 
increased from 15.5 nN to 6968 nN, the displacement of the proof mass increased from 7.7 nm to 
697 nm. Surprisingly, even when the AFM indention force was increased to 6968 nN, the graphene 
membrane did not rupture. For reference, the weight of a 20 µm × 20 µm × 16.4 µm large silicon 
proof mass causes a force due to earth gravity that is on the order of 0.156 nN. Thus, our results 
illustrate that the suspended graphene membranes with attached proof mass are generally very 
robust and potentially useful for application in future NEMS inertial sensors. The corresponding 
average strain in the suspended graphene membranes at the maximum displacement (697 nm) of 
the proof mass is estimated to be on the same order or smaller than the ones reported in AFM 
indentation experiments on fully clamped graphene membranes1,58,59 (Tables S1 and S2 in the 
Supporting Information). We hypothesize that circular graphene membranes and proof mass 
designs might have even better mechanical robustness due to the avoidance of corners that are 
prone to stress concentrations. Another potential advantage of circular membranes and proof mass 
designs is that circular symmetry may result in more uniform strain distributions in the graphene 
membrane.

To analyse the yield of our process, we performed systematic experiments by manufacturing a 
series of graphene membrane structures with different dimensions (trenches widths from 1 µm to 
5 µm and proof masses measuring from 5 µm × 5 µm × 16.4 µm to 100 µm × 100 µm × 16.4 µm)

and characterizing the resulting structures by SEM. We fabricated twelve chips that comprised 672 
structures in different batches, and we obtained similar yields for all chips. Figs. 8-12 show typical 
examples of suspended graphene membranes with different trench widths (1 µm, 2 µm, 3 µm, 4

of 
different 
dimensions 
(from  
5 µm × 5 µm × 16.4 µm to 100 µm × 100 µm × 16.4 µm) after releasing the BOX layers. There 
are some graphene membrane structures without any holes (Fig. 8a-c and Fig. 11a-b). However, 
typically, a few small holes in the suspended graphene membranes were present, although most of 
the structures maintained their mechanical integrity (Fig. 8d, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10). Even for most of 
the 
large 
membranes 
with 
wide 
trenches 
(5 µm) 
and 
large 
proof 
masses  
(100 µm × 100 µm × 16.4 µm), the sizes of the holes were comparably small (Fig. 8d, Fig. 10d, 
Fig. 11d and Fig. 12). For the small membranes with narrow trenches and small proof masses, 
slightly more of the obtained graphene membranes lacked holes or had only very small holes. The 
sizes of the holes in the suspended graphene membranes are related to the dimensions of the 
attached masses and the widths of the trenches. For instance, for structures with 1 µm wide trenches 
and 40 µm × 40 µm × 16.4 µm masses, approximately 15% of the structures were defect-free, 
without any holes in the suspended graphene membranes (Fig. 13a), while approximately 40% of 
the structures had tiny and small-scale (~0-1 µm in side length) holes (Fig. 13b-c), approximately 
35% of the structures had medium-scale (~1-5 µm in side length) holes (Fig. 13d), and 
approximately 10% of the structures had large-scale (> 5 µm in side length) holes (Fig. 13e). The 
reasons that such different sizes of holes occurred in the suspended graphene membranes are not 
presently clear. In-plane tension, shear and compression of the suspended graphene are some 
possibilities. Another possibility is that during graphene wet transfer, there might be some water 
remaining in the trenches after transferring graphene. During the subsequent process steps, the 
water remaining in the trenches might evaporate and rupture the suspended graphene membranes.

In addition, occasional tears might occur at mechanically weak grain boundaries between crystals 
in the CVD growth graphene. We also estimated the yield in dependence of the area of the 
suspended graphene membrane over the trenches, and we found that there was no obvious 
difference among different trench sizes (from 1 µm to 5 µm) or among proof masses with different 
dimensions (from 5 µm × 5 µm × 16.4 µm to 100 µm × 100 µm × 16.4 µm). In this analysis, we 
defined the coverage as the percentage of the area of the suspended graphene over the trenches in 
each structure. For instance, a 100% coverage area, as shown in Fig. 13a, means that there are no 
holes in the graphene membrane. When the widths of the trenches and the sizes of the masses 
increase, the size of the holes in the graphene membrane typically increase. However, the ratio of 
the graphene membrane coverage area to the total trench area was similar among structures with 
different trenches and mass sizes. In summary, approximately 15% of the graphene membranes 
had 100% coverage of the trenches, approximately 75% of the graphene membranes had > 90% 
coverage of the trenches, approximately 90% of the graphene membranes had > 75% coverage of 
the trenches, and approximately 10% of the graphene membranes had < 75% coverage of the 
trenches (Fig. 14).

Discussion 
For certain applications, it is desirable to obtain graphene membranes with as few polymer 
residues on the graphene as possible. Such applications include devices for mechanical and 
electrical characterization of graphene, resonators, high-mobility electronics and gas and 
biomolecule sensors60. During graphene transfer, we used PMMA as a support layer for the 
graphene, as this allowed easy handling and transfer of the graphene. Even after thorough rinsing 
with organic solvents such as acetone, PMMA residues (long-chain molecules) remain adhered to 
the graphene due to the strong dipole interactions between PMMA and chemical groups on 
graphene60. To remove as many of the PMMA residues as possible, we selected some sample chips 
with released proof masses for annealing at 350 ℃ for 2 hours. During the annealing process, the 

===== Page 25 =====

25 
 
temperature was first steadily increased from 100 ℃ to 350 ℃ in 1 hour and then decreased from 
350 ℃ to 100 ℃ in 1 hour. The surface of the graphene after annealing was cleaner (Fig. 12) than 
the surface of graphene without annealing (Fig. 8-12). However, some PMMA residues remained 
on the surface of the graphene even after annealing (Fig. 3b and c). 
 
To evaluate the graphene quality after annealing, one sample chip was annealed at 350 ℃ for 1 
hour in vacuum and subsequently characterized using Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 15). Fig. 15a 
shows the Raman spectra of the double-layer graphene at three different positions of the structure. 
The Raman spectrum shows the typical characteristic peaks of graphene, with the “G peak” 
occurring at approximately 1600 cm-1 (Fig. 15d) and the “2D peak” occurring at approximately 
2700 cm-1 (Fig. 15e), demonstrating the presence of graphene. The relatively weak “D peak” at 
positions 1 and 2 occurring at approximately 1359.6 cm-1 indicates that the quality of the suspended 
graphene membranes might decrease to some extent, while a negligible “D peak” at position 3 
occurring at approximately 1351 cm-1 indicates relatively high quality of graphene (Fig. 15c). The 
inhomogeneous distribution of stress and doping across the graphene patch might result in 
correlated variation in the height and position of Raman peaks to some extent. The impact of hightemperature annealing on graphene, such as enhanced hole doping or defects in graphene, has been 
widely reported on the basis of Raman spectroscopy studies61–64. It was also shown that annealing 
at temperatures below 500°C in vacuum results in a significant decrease in the “D peak” and “2D 
peak” due to annealing-induced enhanced doping in graphene, and annealing in a vacuum at 
temperatures of up to 1000°C results in a significant increase in the “2D peak” with a continuous 
decrease in the “D peak”, indicating the partial removal of the defects and restoration of the 
damaged lattice63.

We experimented with several different process flows to fabricate graphene membranes with 
suspended proof masses and found that wet HF etching was hard to control and often caused 
graphene displacement, wrinkles or collapse of the graphene due to etching of the SiO2 layer 
underneath the graphene65. In addition, the release process of the proof masses occurring in the 
liquid environment (liquid HF, etc.) increased the probability of the masses being detached from 
the suspended graphene membranes due to capillary forces. Only employing HF vapour to etch the 
BOX layer required a very long time and increased the risks associated with over-etching of the 
BOX layer. To increase the yields as well as the quality and efficiency of the fabrication process, 
dry etching followed by vapour HF etching was the preferred approach here. 
 
We also evaluated the possibility of transferring monolayer graphene over the trenches using our 
baseline process (Fig. 1). However, in this way, it was extremely difficult to obtain suspended 
monolayer graphene membranes with attached proof masses at high quality and high yield. When 
using monolayer graphene, our fabrication yield was on the order of 1%, the resulting structures 
were extremely sensitive, and manual handing was difficult without destroying the structures. We 
found that the number of holes in a suspended monolayer graphene was extremely high, the size 
of the holes also increased substantially, and the total coverage area of the suspended monolayer 
graphene decreased substantially compared to the situation with double-layer graphene membranes. 
Furthermore, the suspended monolayer graphene completely disappeared over the trenches in 
many of the fabricated structures. In addition, 100% coverage of monolayer graphene over trenches 

===== Page 28 =====

28 
 
(meaning that there were no holes in the monolayer graphene) was not achieved in our experiments. 
We transferred monolayer graphene over trenches on more than 10 chips, and identical results 
(super low yields) were obtained. Thus, we conclude that double-layer graphene can substantially 
improve the manufacturing yield of membranes with suspended proof masses compared to 
monolayer graphene. Double-layer graphene membranes are much stronger than monolayer 
graphene membranes, which substantially enhances the survival rate of suspended graphene 
membranes in the entire fabrication process. However, if monolayer graphene membranes with 
suspended proof masses can be successfully manufactured, for example, by using high-quality 
CVD monolayer graphene with larger grains that are on the order of hundreds of micrometres in 
diameter, such membranes would be less stiff and of potential interest for future graphene-based 
NEMS devices. We also hypothesize that tri-layer graphene or multi-layer graphene would further 
improve the fabrication yield compared to double-layer graphene, but at the same time, it would 
most likely increase the membrane stiffness. Increased manufacturing yield and device robustness 
could be potentially beneficial for large-scale manufacturing of graphene NEMS devices targeted 
at industrial applications such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and resonators. 
 
In summary, in this paper, we have reported a robust route to transfer and integrate double-layer 
graphene membranes onto a silicon substrate. The proposed manufacturing process is based on SOI 
wafer technology and allows the suspension of large silicon proof masses on graphene membranes. 
Our approach is scalable and highly compatible with silicon NEMS technology and complementary 
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) wafers for the integration of NEMS devices with electronic 
circuits. The ability of the graphene membranes to withstand AFM indentation forces of up to 
~7000 nN without failure indicates that the structures are very robust. Thus, the ability to realize

graphene membranes with suspended large proof masses offers interesting opportunities for ultraminiaturized graphene NEMS devices such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and resonators, with 
exciting applications in nanoscale robotics, autonomous vehicles, wearable as well as consumer 
electronics and the internet of things (IoT).

Materials and methods 
    The SOI wafer was thermally oxidized to grow a 1.4 µm thick SiO2 layer on both sides of the 
wafer (Fig. 1f2). A photoresist (PR) layer was spin-coated on the SiO2 surface and patterned to 
define the trench areas for subsequent etching of the SiO2 and the silicon device layers. Reactive 
ion etching (RIE) was used to etch the SiO2 layer (Fig. 1f3). The 15 μm thick silicon device layer 
was etched with deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) to form the trenches and define the proof masses. 
After silicon trench etching, the remaining PR was removed using oxygen plasma etching (Fig. 1f5 
and Fig. 2a). After trench etching, the backside of the SOI wafer was patterned using a PR layer 
that was spin-coated on the surface of the SiO2 layer on the SOI substrate using lithography with 
backside alignment (Fig. 1g1 and g2). Then, the SiO2 layer was selectively etched by an RIE 
etching process (Fig. 1g3). Both the patterned PR and SiO2 layers were used as protection to pattern 
the silicon handle substrate of the SOI wafer using a DRIE process (Fig. 1g4). The PR residues 
were then removed by an oxygen plasma etch (Fig. 1g5 and Fig. 2b). 
 
    Commercially available CVD monolayer graphene films on copper (Graphenea, Spain) were 
used. A standard wet transfer approach was employed66,67, and double-layer graphene was obtained 
by transferring two graphene monolayers on top of each other (Fig. 1h1-h8). The resulting doublelayer graphene was then transferred from the copper substrate to the prefabricated SOI substrate 
(Fig. 1h9-h11). Then, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution (AR-P 649.04, ALLRESIST, 
Germany) was spin-coated on the front side of the first graphene/copper foils at 500 rpm for 5 s 
followed by 1800 rpm for 30 s and then baked for 5 minutes at 85 ℃ on a hot plate to evaporate 
the solvents and cure the PMMA (approximately 200 nm thick) (Fig. 1h2). Then, carbon residues 
on the backside of the copper foil were removed using O2 plasma etching at low power (80 W)

(Fig. 1h3). For wet etching of the copper, the copper foil was placed in a solution of iron(III) 
chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3), where the copper foil floated on the FeCl3 solution with the graphene 
side facing away from the liquid. Then, with the help of a silicon carrier wafer, the 
PMMA/graphene stack without copper (Fig. 1h4) was first transferred onto the surface of deionized 
(DI) water, then onto a diluted HCl solution and, finally, back to DI water for cleaning, removing 
the FeCl3 residues and removing chloride residues, respectively. During these transfer processes, 
it is necessary to keep the PMMA/graphene stack floating on the surface of the liquids and to keep 
the graphene side on top to ensure that the PMMA covering the graphene is not wetted by the 
etching solutions. A second graphene on copper foil was used for a second graphene layer transfer 
(Fig. 1h5). The PMMA/graphene stack floating on the DI water was transferred on the top side of 
the second graphene/copper foil (Fig. 1h6) and subsequently placed on a hotplate at 45 ℃ to 
increase the adhesion between the two graphene layers. Carbon residues on the backside of the 
copper were removed using O2 plasma etching (Fig. 1h7). A layer of PMMA was spin-coated on 
the surface of the PMMA/double-layer graphene/copper stack (Fig. 1h8) using process parameters 
identical to those used for the transfer of the first graphene layer. Then, the same processes were 
performed to remove the copper substrate (Fig. 1h9) and to transfer the final PMMA/double-layer 
graphene stack to the pre-patterned SOI substrate (Fig. 1h10). The SOI substrate was then baked 
at 45 ℃ on a hotplate for 10 minutes to dry it and to improve the adhesion between the doublelayer graphene and the SiO2 surface. Next, the SOI substrate was placed in acetone for 24 hours to 
remove the PMMA and subsequently placed in isopropanol for 5 minutes to remove the acetone 
residues. A nitrogen gun was used to gently dry the chip, followed by baking at 45 ℃ for 10 minutes 
on a hot plate, which concluded the preparation of the resulting substrates with graphene 
membranes suspended over trenches (Fig. 1h11 and Fig. 2c1-c5).

To freely suspend the silicon proof masses on the double-layer graphene membranes, RIE dry 
etching followed by vapour HF etching was used to effectively remove the BOX layer (2 µm thick 
SiO2) (Fig. 1c), while minimizing the risk of damaging the graphene membranes on the top side of 
the substrate. Therefore, the chips were attached to the surface of a clean 100 mm diameter silicon 
carrier wafer by using Kapton tape (Fig. 1i1). To prevent the plasma and the etching gases (such 
as CHF3, CF4, Ar, O2, N2) from exposing and destroying the graphene, all four sides of the chip 
were sealed by Kapton tape. Then, an RIE etching process was employed to etch the main part of 
the BOX layer (Fig. 1i2). To avoid complete removal of the SiO2 layer and subsequent etching and 
destroying the suspended graphene membranes, only part of the SiO2 layer was etched by carefully 
tuning the etching time for the SiO2 layer to reach a thickness of the remaining SiO2 layer of 
approximately 100 nm. HF vapour was then used to continue etching the 100 nm thick SiO2. The 
vapour HF etching setup (Fig. 2d1) was temperature controlled, and HF vapour was prevented from 
reaching the front side of the substrate while the SiO2 layer still retained its integrity. A 25% HF 
solution was placed in the vapour HF chamber, and the temperature was adjusted to 40 ℃. The 
vapour HF etch rate was calibrated, and the 100 nm thick SiO2 layer was removed in less than 10 
minutes, thereby releasing the silicon proof masses and suspending them from the graphene 
membranes (Fig. 2d). Despite a slight over-etching at the time the SiO2 was removed, the 
suspended graphene membranes were not destroyed by the short exposure to HF vapour. 
 
Optical microscopy and SEM imaging were used to observe and characterize the morphology 
of the devices during and after device fabrication. Raman spectroscopy (alpha300 R, WITec) was 
used to verify the presence and quality of the double-layer graphene of the manufactured devices. 
For static mechanical characterization, an AFM (Dimension Icon, Bruker) with a cantilever 
(Olympus AC240TM) and an AFM tip (tip radius = 15 nm) was used to load defined forces at the 

===== Page 33 =====

33 
 
centre of a proof mass on a graphene membrane to measure the force versus proof mass 
displacement and the maximum force that the suspended graphene membrane can withstand 
without rupture. The spring constant of the AFM cantilever was calibrated to be 5.303 N/m. To 
measure the resonance frequency and quality factor of the structures, we used an LDV (Polytec 
UHF-120) with a laser spot size on the order of 2.5 µm to detect the amplitude of the 
thermomechanical noise of the structures in vacuum (~10-5 mbar actively pumped vacuum) and the 
amplitude of structures that were driven by a piezoshaker in air (atmosphere pressure).
