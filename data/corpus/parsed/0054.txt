Abstract: Pixel sensors using 8′′ CMOS processing technology have been designed and characterized oﬀering the beneﬁts of industrial sensor fabrication, including large wafers, high throughput
and yield, as well as low cost. The pixel sensors are produced using a 150 nm CMOS technology
oﬀered by LFoundry in Avezzano. The technology provides multiple metal and polysilicon layers,
as well as metal-insulator-metal capacitors that can be employed for AC-coupling and redistribution layers. Several prototypes were fabricated and are characterized with minimum ionizing
particles before and after irradiation to ﬂuences up to 1.1 × 1015 neq cm−2. The CMOS-fabricated
sensors perform equally well as standard pixel sensors in terms of noise and hit detection eﬃciency.
AC-coupled sensors even reach 100% hit eﬃciency in a 3.2 GeV electron beam before irradiation.
Keywords: solid state detectors, pixel detectors, radiation-hard detectors, hybrid pixels

Introduction
Hybrid pixel detectors [1] have matured to a level that they are the main contenders for tracking and
vertexing near the interaction point at experiments of the planned LHC upgrade (HL-LHC, [2]). The
surface covered by pixel detectors will likely increase from less than 2 m2 at present to 10–20 m2
in the future. The detectors will be arranged in several concentric cylindrical layers, with radii
between 3–30 cm, and many square meters of disk layers in the forward and backward region of the
detectors.
Industrial CMOS processes on large, high-resistive wafers enable sensor designs with high
yield and high throughput at comparatively low cost. This technology is therefore of interest also
for large area pixel or strip detectors, not only for readout IC fabrication but also for the particle
sensing elements, the sensors. Furthermore, various parts of the CMOS processing technology like
multiple metal layers, polysilicon layers, as well as metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors can be
employed for special sensor features that are otherwise mostly not available. Examples are ACcoupling of the sensor to the readout electronics or obtaining a signiﬁcant module simpliﬁcation
by implementation of redistribution layers for signals and service voltages on the sensor itself
rendering a module ﬂex much simpler or even obsolete. A redistribution of bump connections
by a dedicated metal layer can decouple the sensor pixel pitch from the readout pixel pitch thus
enabling a module design without elongated inter-gap pixels. As the CMOS sensors include no
active electronic circuitry (transistors), they are termed passive CMOS sensors.
In this paper we present radiation hard passive CMOS pixel sensors fabricated in a 150 nm
CMOS process oﬀered by LFoundry [3] on high-resistive wafers (> 2 kΩ-cm).
A number of
prototypes have been characterized with respect to production quality, depletion depth, signal and
noise levels, pixel capacitance, and detection eﬃciency before and after irradiation up to ﬂuences
of 1.1 × 1015 neq cm−2.

Pixel sensor design
Prototype n-in-p pixel sensor matrices have been produced in the LFoundry 150 nm CMOS process
on Czochralski p-type wafers having a foundry speciﬁed resistivity of typically 4–5 kΩ-cm (minimum 2 kΩ-cm). The pixel matrix measures 1.8 × 4 mm2 and is divided into 16 × 36 pixels with a
size of 50 × 250 µm2. The matrix is surrounded by an n-implantation bounding the active volume of
the edge pixels, followed by seven p-implantation guard rings to isolate the electrodes from the high
voltage at the sensor edge (ﬁgure 1). Half of the pixels are DC coupled with punch-through biasing
and the other half is AC coupled by a 3.2 pF MIM capacitor. AC pixels are biased via a 15 MΩ
polysilicon resistor present in each pixel. The pixel layout follows a standard planar pixel design
used, for instance, for the ATLAS IBL planar sensors [4], with a 30 µm wide n-implantation as
readout electrode and a 20 µm gap between pixels to all sides. For the two outermost columns of the
DC half, the n-implantation width has been varied in the range between 15 µm and 30 µm, to allow
for optimization studies of the ﬁll factor with respect to input capacitance and charge-collection
eﬃciency. All pixels are isolated by a 4 µm p-stop grid implemented below ﬁeld plates made of a
low resistive polysilicon layer. The intention of the ﬁeld plates is to ﬂatten spikes in the electric
ﬁeld occurring after irradiation, hence improving the breakdown behavior [5]. A high resolution
mask set was used for processing as the submission was shared with other monolithic active CMOS
devices (DMAPS [8]). The use of such (expensive) mask sets is likely not needed in a dedicated

guard rings (top). The bottom shows 4 edge pixels with bump pads. (left) Pair of AC pixels with a large
area fraction ﬁlled by MIM layers providing the capacitive coupling; (right) pair of DC pixels containing

passive sensor production run. The sensors have been thinned to 100 µm and 300 µm and then
backside processed providing a p-implant and a metallization layer to allow bias voltage application
from the backside. The very thin 100 µm wafer was processed by IBS in France [6] including a
thinning step in a TAIKO process [7]. In this process the wafer edge is left thicker to create a
self-sustainable wafer for further processing without the need of a handling wafer.

Device assembly and characterization procedures
The sensor was bonded to the ATLAS FE-I4 pixel readout-chip [9] via ﬁne pitch solder bump
bonding at Fraunhofer IZM in Berlin [10]. The FE-I4 chip was tuned to threshold values similar to
those used for the IBL layer of the ATLAS pixel detector corresponding to approximately 3000 e−.
The chip was readout with the USBpix 2.0 hardware [11] in combination with pyBAR software, a
Python based readout- and test-system for the ATLAS FE-I4 [12]. The FPGA ﬁrmware modules and
interfaces were provided by basil, a modular data-acquisition and system-testing framework [13].
The sensor eﬃciencies were determined in several test-beam campaigns using minimum ionizing particles. Electrons were used with energies between 2.5 GeV and 3.2 GeV at the electron
stretcher accelerator (ELSA) in Bonn [16] and 120 GeV pions at the super proton synchrotron
(SPS) at CERN [17]. A fast particle telescope based on two ATLAS FE-I4 modules [18] was used
for high-rate test-beams at ELSA to determine the detection and charge collection eﬃciencies for
diﬀerent bias and threshold settings with high statistics. A high resolution telescope (EUDET [19])
based on six Mimosa26 planes [20] and one FE-I4 hybrid pixel time-reference plane was used for
the high-energy test-beam setup at CERN to map with sub-pixel resolution. The synchronization
between data from FE-I4 telescope planes and Mimosa26 planes was established by means of the
JUDITH software [21]. This synchronization is diﬃcult and error prone, since the event integration
time of the Mimosa planes is much longer than the integration time of the ATLAS FE-I4 (115 µs
vs. 0.4 µs). A mismatch between tracks recorded in the Mimosa telescope with hits in the FE-I4
time reference plane assigns a wrong time stamp to these tracks during reconstruction. Every
mismatched track artiﬁcially decreases the determined absolute eﬃciency. Consequentially, the
absolute eﬃciency quoted in this work was always determined with the FE-I4 based telescope,
where synchronization issues due diﬀerent event integration times do not exist.
The subsequent steps of a test-beam analysis involving hit clustering, track ﬁnding and ﬁtting
were carried out using testbeam analysis [22], a novel python package. The performance of testbeam
analysis was veriﬁed by simulation as well as by analyzing test-beam data from well understood
and formerly characterized ATLAS IBL pixel modules [18].
To determine the charge spectra of the sensor a new charge reconstruction method was developed
(TDC method). This method overcomes the limitation of the front-end to measure charge spectra
with suﬃcient resolution by sampling the charge signal with a faster external clock utilizing the
FPGA of the readout system [23].
One sensor has been irradiated with 24 MeV protons at the Birmingham irradiation facility [14]
in steps to 0.18 × 1015 neq cm−2 and 1.14 × 1015 neq cm−2. After each step the sensor was annealed for
80 minutes at 60◦C. The total ﬂuence was measured with about 10% uncertainty by post-irradiation
dosimetry on nickel foils attached to the device during irradiation [15].

I-V curves
To examine the process- and design quality I-V curves (current versus reverse-bias voltage) of 114
sensors have been obtained. The sensors were located on one wafer half of a 300 µm thin wafer
and were contacted at the bias grid by needles on a probe station. The curves in ﬁgure 2 (left)
show very similar electrical characteristics for all sensors. The breakdown requires bias voltages in
excess of 100 V for all 114 sensors and is independent of the sensor’s position on the wafer. Only
one sensor showed a short due to a processing error. The location of the breakdown was determined
via emission microscopy on 5 sensors of the same wafer after dicing and it occurs at the bias dots
of the DC pixels. The right side of ﬁgure 2 depicts results of the IV measurements of two fully

assembled pixel modules after thinning, backside processing, and solder bonding to the ATLAS
FE-I4 chip. Backside processing after thinning included a p+ implantation plus metallization, but
was done without an etching step after backside grinding. It has been observed before [24] that
excessive leakage current can be mitigated by applying etching after grinding. The absence of this
treatment is likely the cause for the observed behavior at 24 V for the 100 µm device (ﬁgure 2,
arrow full depletion).
At this voltage the depletion region reaches the backside, in agreement
with calculations assuming a resistivity of about 5 kΩ-cm (see section 4.3). In order to prove
this hypothesis a dedicated test structure with the same pixel pitch, guard rings, and implantations
was designed and thinned to 100 µm and the backside was treated with plasma etching. It can
be seen in ﬁgure 2 (test structure) that the additional current increase is not occurring anymore
when the depletion zone touches the backside.
The additional current increase at about 160–
180 V for the unirradiated 100 µm and 300 µm is likely a breakdown at the bias dots of the DC
pixels. After irradiation of the sensor assembly the breakdown voltage increases. At an irradiation

A similar measurement at the highest ﬂuence of 1.14 × 1015 neq cm−2 suﬀered an electric discharge
disabling the FE-I4 readout chip functionality, and is thus not available.

charge distributions for AC (dark) and DC (light) coupled pixels. The mean noise for these couplings is
stated in the legend.
Figure 3 (right) shows distributions of the noise for AC and DC coupled pixels determined using
the internal charge injection circuitry of the ATLAS FE-I4 when a 300 µm sensor at 160 V bias is
attached. The distributions have mean values of ENC = 117 e−(DC) and 132 e−(AC). This should
be compared to the noise performance of planar IBL sensors (ENC ≈120 e−[18], CD = 117 fF [25])
and IBL 3D-Si sensors (ENC ≈140 e−[18], CD = 180 fF [25]) showing that the noise performance
of the passive CMOS sensor investigated here is comparable. Hence we conclude that the DC
coupled pixels have an input capacitance less than 120 fF and the AC coupled pixel less than 180 fF.
The larger value for the AC coupled sensors arises from the parasitic capacitance of the polysilicon
layer by which the bias resistor is implemented. The values for the bias resistor and coupling
capacitance were not optimized in the design, but chosen as large as possible, leaving room for
input capacitance optimization in future designs.

Depletion depth
Assuming that in silicon a minimum ionizing particle creates about 71 e/h pairs per micron (most
probable value, from GEANT4 simulation) and that only the depleted volume of the sensor contributes to the charge signal (due to the fast response time of the FE-I4) we determine the depletion

Depletion depth as a function of bias voltage for the 300 µm thick LFoundry passive pixel
sensor. The depletion depth was calculated using Langau ﬁts as in ﬁgure 3 assuming 71 e/h pairs created per
micrometer. Theoretical depletion curves for three bulk resistivities given by 4.1 are shown for comparison.
Figure 4 shows the measured depletion depth assuming 71 e/h pairs created per micron using
the most probable value of measured charge distributions as in ﬁgure 3 (left) extracted by a ﬁt to a
so-called Langau distribution [26], a Landau distribution [27] folded with a Gaussian. The measured
depletion depths at diﬀerent bias voltages are compared to theoretical curves obtained from (4.1)
assuming three diﬀerent values for the (p-type) bulk resistivity. The error bars of the measurements
are deﬁned by the ﬁt error and the uncertainty of the calibration of the charge-injection circuitry of
the ATLAS FE-I4. One can conclude that the resistivity of the bulk material of the measured wafer
is at least 4–5 kΩ-cm, a value compatible with the range quoted by the vendor.

Hit detection eﬃciency
The hit detection eﬃciency has been determined using 3.2 GeV electrons for sensors thinned
to 100 µm (unirradiated) and 300 µm (three levels of radiation:
0, 0.18 × 1015 neq cm−2 and
1.14 × 1015 neq cm−2).
The results are shown in ﬁgure 5.
The hit eﬃciency reaches values
of 98.7%/99.8% for the DC/AC coupled 100 µm sensor pixels at a standard threshold of about
3000 electrons and increases to 99.8%/> 99.9% after reducing the threshold to about 1500 electrons. After irradiation the eﬃciency reaches values > 99.9% for AC coupled sensors at bias

histogram with 10 µm x 10 µm bins of the intersection points of reconstructed particles tracks with
the sensor. The ratio of tracks that created a hit in the sensor, within an association distance of
500 µm, divided by the total number of tracks gives the eﬃciency per bin. While the eﬃciency
of the AC coupled pixels is homogenous, it is possible to observe an eﬃciency loss at the bias
dots located in the DC coupled pixels. The absolute eﬃciency is underestimated (see section 3)
explaining a lower eﬃciency in comparison to ﬁgure 5.

Conclusions
In this paper we presented pixel sensors fabricated in a CMOS process line using high ohmic
(∼5kΩ-cm) substrate wafers. Employing CMOS technology provides several beneﬁts for large area
pixel detectors such as those planned for the HL-LHC upgrade at CERN, namely: low cost, large
through-put production on 8′′ or even 12′′ wafers, and design ﬂexibility (e.g. AC coupling, routing)
while keeping the charge collection properties of standard sensors. The wafers were fabricated
using LFoundry 150 nm technology. The sensors were thinned to 300 µm and 100 µm thickness and
were backside processed. A sensor breakdown after irradiation to more than 1015 neq cm−2 did not
occur up to a maximum applied voltage of 700 V. Measured signal and noise performance was found
to be very similar to those of planar pixel sensors currently used in the ATLAS experiment. The
hit-eﬃciency after irradiation was measured in an electron test-beam to be above 99.9% (99.1%)
for AC- (DC)-coupled sensor-chip assemblies.
