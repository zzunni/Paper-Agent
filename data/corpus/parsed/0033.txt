Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are vital for developing affordable, high-performance optoelectronic
devices that can be manufactured at an industrial scale, driving innovation and efficiency in various applications. Optical
loss of modes in thin film waveguides and devices is a critical measure of their performance. Thin films growth,
lithography, masking, and etching processes are imperfect processes that introduce significant sidewall and top-surface
roughness and cause dominating optical losses in waveguides and photonic structures. These roughness as perturbations
couple light from guided to far-field radiation modes, leading to scattering losses that can be estimated from theoretical
models. Typically, with UV-based lithography sidewall roughness is found to be significantly larger than wafer-top
surface roughness. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging measurement gives 3D and high-resolution roughness
profile but the measurement is inconvenient, costly, and unscalable for large-scale PICs and at wafer-scale. Here,
we evaluate the sidewall roughness profile based on 2D high-resolution scanning electron microscope imaging. We
characterized the loss on two homemade nitride and oxide films on 3-inch silicon wafers with 12 waveguide devices on
each and co-related the scattering loss estimated from a 2D image-based sidewall profile and theoretical Payne model.
The lowest loss of guided fundamental transverse electric (TE0) is found at 0.075 dB/cm at 633 nm across 24 devices,
which is a record at visible wavelength. Our work shows a 100% success in edge detection in image processing to
estimate autocorrelation function and optical mode loss. These demonstrations offer valuable insights into waveguide
sidewall roughness and comparison of experimental and 2D SEM image-processing-based loss estimations.

Introduction
Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are vital in advancing various technologies, including high-speed optical communication, optical interconnects, PIC-based optical clocks, neural networks-based optical computing, sensing, light sources,
and quantum circuits [1–4]. Manufacturing these devices on a large scale requires precise and scalable fabrication
techniques and processes for high-performance yield. The critical components of these procedures are lithography,
patterning, and etching of material to develop the photonic components on the chip. The primary techniques are
photolithography and electron-beam lithography (EBL), with photolithography being the predominant choice in the
industry. Although it has resolution limitations, it is generally preferred for all applications except prototypes because
of its speed, cost-effectiveness, and scalability. In the large-scale manufacture of PICs, photolithography enables the
simultaneous patterning of entire wafers, rapidly producing hundreds or thousands of PIC components within minutes.
In atomic and molecular research applications, resolutions within the 50-100 nm range are generally sufficient for
PIC architectures and components in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, making deep UV photolithography more
practical [5]. In contrast, EBL offers higher resolution and can achieve features as small as 5 nm, but it is significantly
expensive and slower, taking hours or even days for a single wafer. EBL allows design flexibility without requiring new
masks; its high operational costs make it better suited for prototyping and small-scale production.
The resolution of a lithographic process is determined by a simplified version of the Rayleigh criterion, 𝑅= 𝑘1·𝜆
𝑁𝐴, where,
𝑅is the smallest resolvable feature size (resolution), 𝜆is the wavelength of the light source, 𝑁𝐴is the numerical
aperture of the imaging system, 𝑘1 is a process constant dependent on the resist and the patterning technique (typically
around 0.4 to 0.9 in practical photolithography processes), the resolution improves with shorter wavelengths (𝜆) and
higher numerical apertures (NA) [6]. In photolithography, ongoing research and advancements aim to reduce the costs
of small wavelength laser sources and hardware components, enhancing device yield performance. The 365 nm (i-line)
wavelength works well for older semiconductor devices, while the 248 nm and 193 nm wavelengths accommodate
increasingly smaller features, achieving down to 65 nm for advanced photolithography [7]. The state-of-the-art 13.5 nm
(EUV) technology allows for features patterning as tiny as 10 nm, underscoring the industry’s commitment to developing
more intricate circuits. In visible-telecom wavelengths, PICs necessitate minimum feature sizes for components like
waveguides, microring resonators, on-chip modulators, photonic crystal waveguides, and cavities, roughly around 50
nm.

Thin film growth, lithography patterning, masking, and etching processes are imperfect processes that introduce
significant sidewall and top-surface roughness and cause dominating optical losses in waveguides and photonic
structures. These roughnesses act as perturbations that couple light from guided to far-field radiation modes, leading
to unwanted scattering losses. Waveguide loss is evaluated as the total loss quantity, 𝛼includes all the effects such
as radiative loss, surface and sidewall roughness loss, absorption in material, material defects, mechanical defects,
etc. Sidewall roughness is significantly larger than wafer-top surface roughness due to high-quality thin film, lowquality resist edges, and top-down etching process. Scattering losses from sidewall (𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙) and surface (𝛼𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒)
roughness are typically the most dominant factors among all for a straight rectangular waveguide. Evaluating loss
due to this roughness using Maxwell’s solvers like FDTD is impractical and is measured directly from experimental
observations. Experimental methods include high-resolution roughness measurements using atomic force microscopy
and optical characterization of waveguide loss. Experiments measure average loss, i.e., 𝛼= 𝛼𝑎𝑣𝑔. =
Í
𝑖𝛼𝑖𝐿𝑖
Í
𝑖𝐿𝑖, where
𝛼𝑖is optical loss of 𝐿𝑖waveguide length unless advanced imaging and optical characterization are performed such
as confocal microscopy - which is quite a challenging task because the loss of photons is minimal for typical used
optical powers, slow speed measurement and require additional experimental verifications with high accuracy. Loss
measurement is a significant factor in characterizing PIC components. As such, the Q-factor of an on-chip integrated cavity is estimated from total loss quantity, 𝛼[8]. For the microring resonator, the total loss is evaluated as
𝛼𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔= 2𝜋𝑛𝑔/(𝑄𝜆) = 𝛼𝑚𝑎𝑡.+𝛼𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡.+𝛼𝑇𝐼𝑅; in the case of non-symmetric edges of waveguides, 𝛼𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡. = 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒1+𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒2.
Similarly, for photonic crystal cavity the optical loss, 𝛼= 𝛼𝑇𝐼𝑅+ 𝛼𝑚𝑎𝑡. + 𝛼𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡. and the Q factor is estimated by,
1/𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡. = 1/𝑄𝑇𝐼𝑅+1/𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑡. +1/𝑄𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡. [9]. Note that, 𝛼𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡. > 𝛼𝑇𝐼𝑅> 𝛼𝑚𝑎𝑡. therefore, 1/𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡. = 1/𝑄𝑇𝐼𝑅+1/𝑄𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡..
For a PIC with thousands of components and a large number of PICs in industry-scale manufacturing, characterization
of loss quantity with direct optical measurements is not feasible. As the next photonics revolution awaits, a quick
and efficient measurement technique of the optical loss quantity is needed. Electron microscope images can extract
features sub-10 nm size characteristics of devices and have been used as feedback in the FDTD simulator to estimate
actual photonic device performance [9]. However, FDTD is a computationally time-consuming and intensive method
to estimate scattering loss and evaluate device performance. A combined methodology of quick measurement of
the roughness of waveguide edge based on high-resolution imaging and loss estimation using a theoretical model
would be advantageous in characterizing micro and macro parameters, optical losses, and the performance of PIC
devices. 2D (electron microscopy) and 3D (atomic force microscopy, focused ion beam tomography, confocal microscopy) imaging methods are crucial in analyzing surface features and sidewall structures. SEM is considerably
high-resolution, cheaper, faster, and more convenient; however, it overlooks the chiseling effect (variation over the
depth of waveguide edge roughness), though this is minimal due to the top-down etching process. The sem resolution
limit, 𝑅SEM = 𝐶𝑠·𝜆
𝛼, where 𝐶𝑠is the spherical aberration coefficient of the lens, 𝜆is the wavelength of the electrons and
𝛼is the semi-angle of the electron beam convergence. At typical SEM operating voltages (10-100 kV), the electron
wavelength 𝜆is on the order of picometers, making it possible to achieve high resolution [10]. However, aberrations
such as spherical and chromatic aberrations degrade the resolving power of the system. Non-conductive samples require coating with a thin conductive layer (e.g., gold or carbon) to prevent charging effects, which can obscure fine details.
In this research investigation, we perform image processing on SEM images of waveguide edges to characterize the
roughness, use a theoretical model to empirically estimate the waveguide loss, and compare it with the experimentally
observed loss at a wafer-scale level.
2.
Theoretical loss and waveguide edge roughness
The analytical expression of radiation loss coefficient for scattering by surface roughness in a symmetric single-mode
waveguide that is based on coupled-mode theory (by Marcuse in 1969) was reported by Payne et al. [11,12],

and scattering loss based on three-dimensional models using coupled-mode theory (2006) and volume current method
(2005) have been reported by Poulton et al. and Barwicz et al., respectively [13,14]. These models have accurately
predicted losses in low and high-contrast refractive index core waveguides and cladding. In Eq. 1, if one wall is
rough, then 𝛼must be multiplied by 1/2, 𝜑(𝑑) is the modal field evaluated at the waveguide surface and is normalized

so that,
∫∞
−∞𝜑2(𝑦) 𝑑𝑦= 1; 𝑛1 and 𝑛2 are the core and cladding refractive indices, respectively; 𝑘0 is the free-space
wavenumber and 𝛽is the modal propagation constant; the width of the waveguide is 2𝑑. For the bent waveguide,
the loss, 𝛼= 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒1 + 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒2, where the mode field at both sides is to be estimated numerically from the EME
or FDTD method. The surface roughness of the waveguide walls is described by the spectral density function
˜𝑅(Ω), which is related to the autocorrelation function (ACF) 𝑅(𝑢) of the surface roughness through the Fourier
transform, ˜𝑅(Ω) =
∫∞
−∞𝑅(𝑢) exp(𝑖Ω𝑢) 𝑑𝑢[11,12]. The roughness described by R(u) is a function of f(z) - which is a
one-dimensional distribution with zero mean, 𝑅(𝑢) = ⟨𝑓(𝑧) 𝑓(𝑧+ 𝑢)⟩, where the brackets represent ensemble average,
in case of the straight waveguide, f(z) is a variation of edges around the ideal straight waveguide [13,14]. In the case of
a bent waveguide, the edge curve of the waveguide can be best fitted to a polynomial function. Now, the models mostly
used for ACF that closely relate to the roughness produced by photolithography, hard-mask, and top-down etching
processes in the fab are: 𝑅(𝑢) = 𝜎2 exp

The surface roughness is characterized by a correlation length 𝐿𝑐, and mean square deviation 𝜎2 from a flat surface,
where 𝜎2 = 𝑅(0). In waveguide roughness, ACF is useful in understanding spatial dependencies in surface or edge
variation. The ACF measures how a roughness profile correlates with itself at different location lags. Other models
include, 𝑅(𝑢) = 𝐴0𝑒−𝑢

but numerically, it can be estimated.
Image processing of SEM images to extract ACF involves a crucial step of precise edge detection. Various edge
detection algorithms can identify image boundaries based on sudden shifts in pixel intensity, including Canny, Sobel,
Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian, and Difference of Gaussians (DoG), etc. We discuss these algorithms here briefly.
Canny’s algorithm is a multi-stage algorithm that enhances accuracy through noise reduction, gradient computation, and
hysteresis thresholding; however, it requires careful parameter tuning [15]. Sobel utilizes two 3x3 convolution kernels to
approximate gradients in horizontal and vertical directions, offering computational efficiency and some noise reduction
but struggles in low-contrast environments. The Prewitt operator is similar but lacks weight for the central pixel, making
it less accurate and more noise-sensitive. The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) combines Gaussian smoothing with the
Laplace operator to detect edges through zero-crossings but can be compromised by noise if not correctly adjusted.
Each technique presents a unique balance of accuracy, noise sensitivity, and computational complexity, catering to
diverse computer vision and image analysis applications. The Canny algorithm is the most accurate for general use and
offers excellent noise reduction and edge localization. The Canny’s algorithm consists of applying a Gaussian filter to
smooth the image, 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦) =
1
2𝜋𝜎2 𝑒−𝑥2+𝑦2
2𝜎2 and convolving the image 𝐼(𝑥, 𝑦) with 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦) reduces high-frequency noise,
computation of the intensity gradients using operators like Sobel filters, non-maximum suppression by thin the edges to
one-pixel width by suppressing non-maximum gradient magnitudes, double thresholding by applying two thresholds to
classify pixels as firm edges, weak edges, or non-edges and edge tracking by hysteresis to finalize edge detection by
connecting weak edges that are linked to solid edges [16]. To accurately capture image details, the sampling frequency
must satisfy the Nyquist criterion: 𝑓𝑠≥2 𝑓max, where 𝑓𝑠is the sampling frequency, and 𝑓max is the highest frequency
present in the image. Higher resolution (higher 𝑓𝑠) allows for accurate representation of high-frequency details, which
is crucial for precise edge detection. The effectiveness of this algorithm is influenced by image resolution and pixel
count. Higher resolution typically enhances the accuracy of imaging systems; however, it also contributes to increased
computational complexity (𝑇Canny ∝𝑁= 𝑁𝑥× 𝑁𝑦). If an image has dimensions 𝑁𝑥pixels in width and 𝑁𝑦pixels in
height, the total pixel count 𝑁is: 𝑁= 𝑁𝑥× 𝑁𝑦. The physical size of each pixel depends on the imaging sensor or
sampling process. The spatial resolution 𝑅(in pixels per unit length) can be expressed as: 𝑅𝑥= 𝑁𝑥
𝐿𝑥,
𝑅𝑦= 𝑁𝑦
𝐿𝑦, where
𝐿𝑥and 𝐿𝑦are the physical dimensions of the image along the x and y axes, respectively. The pixel size Δ𝑥and Δ𝑦
(physical distance represented by each pixel) are: Δ𝑥=
1
𝑅𝑥= 𝐿𝑥
𝑁𝑥,
Δ𝑦=

𝑅𝑦= 𝐿𝑦

𝐼(𝑥, 𝑦) is a key component in edge detection, defined as: ∇𝐼=

. In discrete images, gradients are approximated
using finite differences: 𝜕𝐼

𝜕𝑦≈𝐼(𝑖, 𝑗+1)−𝐼(𝑖, 𝑗−1)

. Smaller Δ𝑥and Δ𝑦(higher resolution) lead to
more accurate gradient estimations, improving edge detection accuracy [17].

Results and Discussion
To investigate and demonstrate the estimation of optical loss at a wafer-level scale using a theoretical model combined
with high-resolution sem image processing, we fabricated two silicon nitride waveguide wafers, each containing 12
waveguide devices designed for characterizing optical loss in waveguides. Each device includes a single optical
waveguide that splits into two waveguide branches, with one waveguide branch intentionally designed to have a
longer length. This variation in path lengths and precise output power measurements facilitate the quantification of
optical losses. The measurement process involves coupling a continuous-wave laser into the input waveguide using a
high-precision alignment setup, ensuring optimal coupling efficiency as shown in Fig. 1. As the light propagates through
the two branches, losses due to scattering, absorption, and fabrication imperfections accumulate along the path length.
At the output, each branch’s light intensity is measured using a photodetector - power meter. The power difference
between the two outputs directly correlates with the optical loss per unit length, as the longer waveguide accumulates
proportionally greater loss. To ensure accuracy, the two waveguide branches’ length difference is identical for each
device, and multiple measurements are conducted to account for variations in input coupling and environmental factors.

and polarized and then coupled to fiber that is butt-coupled to a photonic chip waveguide; output diverging beams pass

e) Side-view image in a dark room with light coupled to waveguide chip with an objective-stage system and f) two output

In intermediate steps of image processing and experimental characterization, first, the waveguide is patterned with the
lithography and etching process followed by deposition of a thin Gold (Au) nanoparticles layer for acquiring sem images.
A thin Au layer was deposited on the wafer to achieve high-contrast images. After obtaining the images, the Au layer
was etched away using an Au etchant, followed by a cleaning procedure. After that, a silica layer (upper cladding) with a
thickness of 1 𝜇m is deposited on the wafer. Each wafer was cut into 12 individual dies using a diamond cutter, each
representing one device. Each die was placed under an optical setup as illustrated in Fig. 1. The waveguide architecture
included a Y-splitter that divided the waveguide into two outputs. These outputs were collected on a white screen or
power meter for loss characterization of the devices. The optical loss for each device was estimated and presented in Fig.
2. The observed optical loss ranged from 0.18 to 0.36 dB/cm for wafer 1, while for wafer 2, it ranged from 0.39 to 0.73
dB/cm across the 12 devices. We believe the loss discrepancy between the two wafers can be attributed to variations in
the fabrication processes conducted on different days. The supplementary information presents details of fabrication,
experimental procedure, image processing, edge detection algorithms, and optical loss estimation.
To estimate the edge roughness by edge detection processing on sem images, we collected 90 sem images of the
waveguide edge sections from each of the fabricated wafers. An illustration of image processing performed on SEM

images is shown in Fig. 3 to extract the waveguide edges’ ACF and roughness parameters. First, the pixel scale
information is extracted from the original image. The pixel scale in nanometers is converted by fitting the endpoints of
the scalebar to its numerical value within the image. Following this, the image underwent sigmoid correction, and an
edge detection algorithm was used to identify the waveguide edges. These detected edges were then fitted to an ideal
expected straight line, and the resulting ACF was plotted.
Fig. 4 shows the result of edge detection algorithm parameters variation on a SEM image. Sigmoid correction gain and
canny edge detection sigma parameters vary, affecting the final edge detection. This indicates the need to optimize
these two parameters to find single-edge detection at the edge. We performed a particle-swarm optimization process
and maximized the edge length to achieve 100 percent success in detecting an edge for a given waveguide SEM image.
We evaluated ACF for each 90 images randomly acquired from a wafer, in total 180 images for two wafers. Fig. 5
shows the histograms of the computed
√︁
𝑅(𝑢= 0) values derived from 90 SEM images of the respective wafers - (a)
and (b) corresponding to two wafers. The results indicate that the observed differences in losses are linked to increased
sidewall roughness of the waveguides, as evidenced by the variations in the computed
√︁
𝑅(𝑢= 0) values between the
two wafers. The mean
√︁
𝑅(𝑢= 0) for the first wafer was 5.86 nm, while for the second wafer, it measured 8.58 nm.
Notably, the first wafer exhibited a spread of up to 2 nm distribution around its mean value. In contrast, the second
wafer displayed a distribution of approximately 3-4 nm, with three values falling within the 15-17 nm range. The
extracted values from fitted data characterize the waveguide sidewall roughness, 𝐿𝑐∼100 nm, a mean 𝜎of 5.86 nm
and 8.58 nm (wafer 1 and 2 respectively), 𝜆∼633 nm, an effective refractive index (𝑛eff) of 1.5, and refractive indices
𝑛1 = 2.0 and 𝑛2 = 1.46, along with a phase-related parameter 𝜙𝑑= 0.3. Using these inputs, the free-space wavenumber
is calculated as 𝑘0 = 2𝜋
𝜆and the propagation constant is given by 𝛽= 𝑛eff · 𝑘0. See supplementary material for the
theoretical expression of S. Based on the calculation, the loss is 0.08 dB/cm and 0.16 dB/cm for wafers 1 and 2, respectively.

quality between the homemade and commercial nitride films.
We further report the comparison of surface roughness between commercially bought stoichiometric LPCVD nitride
film (Rogue Valley Microdevices) and our homemade fabricated LPCVD nitride films (see Fig. 6) based on surface
AFM measurements. The AFM tool used in this measurement has vertical (Z) and horizontal (XY) axes resolution ∼1
nm and ∼10 nm, respectively. The commercially available silicon nitride thin film of thickness 200 nm demonstrates a
lower root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.41 nm compared to the home-manufactured silicon nitride thin film of
thickness 40 nm, exhibiting an RMS roughness of 2.04 nm as shown in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, the surface roughness of
the home-manufactured film remains within an acceptable range. It is pertinent to consider that both surface roughness
values are relatively low when juxtaposed with the typical edge roughness observed in side-wall roughness of waveguides
as observed, which exceeds three to four times these values. This observation suggests that, in the context of optical
losses, the surface roughness of these films is unlikely to be the predominant factor when compared to the inherent
roughness at the edges of waveguides. Nevertheless, in both cases, the surface roughness is several times less than the

edge roughness; therefore, sidewall roughness losses dominate the total optical waveguide loss demonstrated in this
work.

Discussion and Conclusion
Modeling sidewall roughness and scattering losses are vital in estimating the waveguide loss, and there is a need to reduce
the complexity in an optical characterization procedure to calculate the optical losses of photonic waveguide-based
devices [8,18] so that the process can be scaled to a large number of devices in a convenient and efficient way. In this
study, we examined SEM images taken at various locations of straight waveguide edge sections and derived the values
of Lc and sigma through ACF fitting data. The Lc and sigma values differ within the fabricated devices across 3-inch
PICs and two distinct wafers.
This work can potentially be applied to characterize various photonic devices, such as the Q-factor of on-chip microring
cavities, the Q-factor of photonic crystals, and the losses of waveguide crossing optical modes. Since the intrinsic
Q-factor of cavities is approximated based on the total and where sidewall roughness scattering prevails, sidewall
roughness scattering loss equals the total loss, as discussed in the introduction.
Various theories for modeling roughness-induced scattering loss in rectangular waveguides exhibit significant variations in loss estimations [11, 13, 14]. However, the definite understanding is that roughness (ACF and roughness,
sigma factor) contributes to scattering-induced radiation loss or light loss from a waveguide. Without loss of generality, we can characterize photonic waveguide-based devices and waveguide losses by evaluating S factor, where
𝑆=
∫𝜋
0
˜𝑅(𝛽−𝑛2𝑘0 cos 𝜃) 𝑑𝜃. For instance, in waveguide crossing, comparison of S values of different waveguide
crossings, a relative loss estimate can be made if not absolute value. Additionally, from the perspective view for
future work, machine learning can be effectively utilized, a predictive framework can be established by training a
model on experimental or simulated data correlating roughness parameters -such as amplitude, correlation length, and
standard deviation - with waveguide loss. This approach would address the computational challenges associated with
traditional numerical simulations in complex PIC architectures. The trained model can generalize the roughness-loss
relationship by incorporating features like waveguide dimensions, material properties, and roughness metrics, facilitating
rapid predictions across diverse designs. This methodology could potentially be a valuable tool for optimizing PIC
performance and minimizing losses, circumventing the need for costly and time-intensive full-scale simulations or
experimental assessments.
In this work, we demonstrated wafer-scale silicon nitride waveguide optical loss characterization with sem image
processing and compared it with experiments. We tested 12 devices on each of two wafers, and 0.075 dB/cm was the
lowest loss observed at 633 nm. We demonstrated low-loss waveguides on homemade silicon nitride and oxide films at
633 nm. This experimental result adds a new record in previously reported low-loss nitride films for photonic waveguides
and devices. We demonstrated the application of edge detection algorithms to characterize the edge roughness and
evaluated optical loss employing a theoretical model. The statistics of waveguide edge roughness over 90 sem images for
each wafer are demonstrated. The minimum resolution of roughness estimation achieved in our work is ∼4 nm, which
is not limited by a fundamental principle. The work presented here would be valuable in potentially characterizing
the photonic devices on large-scale PIC efficiently and quickly, which is a far better option than AFM imaging based
roughness estimation.
