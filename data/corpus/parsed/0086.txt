This paper provides an accurate theoretical defect energy database for pure and Bi-containing 
111-V (111-V:Bi) materials and investigates efficient methods for high-throughput 
defect calculations 
based on corrections of results obtained with local and semi-local functionals. Point defects as well as 
nearest-neighbor and second-nearest-neighbor 
pair defects were investigated in charge states ranging 
from -5 to 5. Ga-V:Bi systems (GaP:Bi, GaAs:Bi, and GaSb:Bi) were thoroughly investigated 
with significantly slower, higher fidelity hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof 
(HSE) and significantly 
faster, lower fidelity local density approximation 
(LDA) calculations. In both approaches spurious 
electrostatic 
interactions were corrected with the Freysoldt correction. 
The results were verified 
against available experimental results and used to assess the accuracy of a previous band alignment 
correction. Here, a modified band alignment method is proposed in order to better predict the HSE 
values from the LDA ones. The proposed method allows prediction of defect energies with values 
that approximate those from the HSE functional at the computational 
cost of LDA (about 20x 
faster for the systems studied here). Tests of selected point defects in In-V :Bi materials resulted 
in corrected LDA values having a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.175 eV for defect levels vs. 
HSE. The method was further verified on an external database of defects and impurities in CdX 
(X=S, Se, Te) systems, yielding a MAE = 0.194 eV. These tests demonstrate the correction to be 
sufficient for qualitative and semi-quantitative 
predictions, and may suggest transferability to many 
semiconductor systems without significant loss in accuracy. Properties of the remaining In-V :Bi 
defects and all Al-V :Bi defects were predicted with the use of the modified band alignment method.

INTRODUCTION 
There are many challenges to obtaining defect properties from direct experimental characterization, therefore 
theoretical predictions of point defect properties are very 
valuable. 
For example, DLTS is widely used to study 
defects (traps for carriers) in semiconductors since this 
technique provides experimental information on the trap 
energy level, capture cross section and trap concentration 
but lacks the ability to identify the defect type [l]. Advanced electron microscopy techniques are able to identify the defect type [2-4] but the measurements are expensive, destructive, difficult to properly perform, and 
require time-consuming sample preparation. 
First principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect levels aid interpretation 
of results obtained with DLTS or other methods and are often used 
in defect characterization. 
DFT also enables exploration 
of a full suite of defect types and interactions and offer 
physical insight into defect and associated electronic and 
optical properties of a material. Correct DFT treatment 
of defects in semiconductors requires the use of supercells 
with many atoms and a proper description of both the 
total energy of the system and its electronic band struc-

ture. 
Recent developments of computational 
methods 
such as hybrid functionals and corrections of the spurious electrostatic interactions, allow for accurate theoretical predictions. However, the use of these high fidelity 
methods also results in very time consuming and computationally expensive calculations, which typically limits 
researchers to focus only on a small number of specific 
defect types or a particular material system. Therefore, 
in order to investigate large range of systems, defects and 
charge states, approximate but more efficient methods 
are necessary. 
The goal of this work is two-fold. First, to provide 
and assess potential methods to reduce the computational effort required to obtain defect formation energies 
and defect levels, while preserving relatively high accuracy. Here, band alignment based corrections, as well as 
machine learning methods, are investigated. Second, to 
use the most efficient of these methods to build a highlyaccurate first principles defect energy database for pure 
and Bi-containing III-V (III-V:Bi) materials. 
Dilute bismides are group III-V semiconductors with 
bismuth as an isovalent dopant replacing a modest percentage ( typically 10% or less) of the group V host atoms. 
They have attracted interest in the past 10 or so years 
mostly due to a significant reduction of the band gap 
with relatively low Bi concentration and a large increase 
in the spin-orbit splitting [5-8]. Specifically, when the Bi 
concentration in GaAsi-xBix approaches 12% the spinPreprint

orbit splitting exceeds the band gap energy, Auger re­
combination is suppressed which results in higher device 
efficiency when the material is used in long wavelength 
laser devices [9]. Additionally, alloying with bismuth is 
the only way to obtain a group III-V material with a 
band gap lower than that of InAsi-xSbx, which is nec­
essary for mid-infrared (MIR) devices. So far, the MIR 
spectral range is usually covered by using the group II­
VI alloy Hg1_xCdx Te. However, there are many disad­
vantages of using this material, such as instability and 
lack of compositional uniformity [10, 11], as well as the 
use of environmentally hazardous and highly toxic Hg 
and Cd elements. A III-V compound with properties 
favorable for use in MIR devices would provide a possi­
bility to overcome the challenges of using Hg1-xCdx Te. 
Such a compound would also enable processing of MIR­
compatible materials using highly developed III-V indus­
try technologies, allowing easy integration with existing 
infrastructure. Some optoelectronic structures based on 
dilute bismides such as photodetectors [12-14] and re­
cently even laser structures [15, 16], have been developed 
and shown promising results, encouraging further devel­
opment. It is evident, that dilute bismides are an active 
field of research, with focus not only on Ga- and In-based 
III-V:Bi systems, but now also extending to Al- based,
with AlSb1_xBix having been synthesized for the first as 
recently as last year [17]. 
Point defects properties are particularly important to 
establish for dilute bismide semiconductor systems. This 
importance arises primarily because many dilute bis­
mides can be regarded as highly mismatched semicon­
ductor alloys (HMAs) due to the significant discrepancy 
of the electronegativity and size of the Bi atoms com­
pared with the atoms comprising the host III-V com­
pounds. Dilute bismide systems are known for being dif­
ficult to manufacture. In order to incorporate Bi atoms 
into the III-V host, the growth conditions have to be 
adjusted, typically to a significantly lower growth tem­
perature than that optimal for pure III-V host materi­
als [18-23]. As a consequence, undesired defects often 
form during III-V:Bi growth, which defects often function 
as traps for carriers, in turn lowering device efficiency. 
Because of poor optical quality of HMAs, post growth 
annealing is often applied in order to increase the effi­
ciency of luminescence [24-26]. It is believed that for di­
lute nitrides, the enhancement of luminescence is related 
to reduction of the concentration of point defects due to 
annealing [24, 27, 28]. In the case of dilute bismides, 
post growth annealing has also been performed [29-34], 
but its role in the improvement of the material quality 
is still unclear. However, defects are expected to be con­
tributing to the annealing response. Overall, defects are 
likely to play a key role in these systems and knowledge of 
their properties may help improve materials performance. 
Specifically, the defect data included in this study can 
guide the growth process or annealing conditions and en­
able better interpretation of the results of defect proper­
ties measured by spectroscopic, optical or electrical methdoi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
ods, such as deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), 
photoluminescence, or temperature-dependent Hall mea­
surements. Although a few studies focused on particu­
lar materials (GaAs:Bi and GaSb:Bi) and defect types 
exist [35-38], a comprehensive study has not been per­
formed, until now. The data and knowledge contained 
in this work provide powerful tools for understanding 
the performance limitations and improving the quality 
of grown structures. 
An optimized band alignment correction is proposed, 
where results of significantly faster, lower-fidelity local 
density approximation (LDA) (and other local and semi­
local functionals) calculations are corrected to approach 
the accuracy of significantly slower, higher-fidelity hy­
brid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE) calcula­
tions. Related to the correction, it has been proposed 
that much of the improvement associated with HSE vs. 
LDA can be obtained by a simple band alignment (BA) 
correction to the LDA energy levels [39-45]. Such an ap­
proach can potentially produce results that come close 
to HSE-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational 
cost (typically more than an order of magnitude reduc­
tion in computing time). However, the BA approach 
has only been tested on a handful of defect types and 
systems, and therefore has not yet been thoroughly as­
sessed and may not yet be fully optimized. To develop 
our database and explore a band alignment based ap­
proach to improving LDA results, all Ga-V:Bi materials 
were studied directly with both the lower accuracy LDA 
method and the higher accuracy HSE approach. We de­
termined formation energies for all charge states for na­
tive and Bi-related point defects as well as nearest- and 
second-nearest-neighbor pair defects. Then, we applied 
the BA correction method to the LDA results and as­
sessed the accuracy of this correction against HSE. Based 
on the result of the BA correction, we propose an addi­
tional empirical correction, which we call the modified 
band alignment (MBA) method. The MBA includes a 
band gap-dependent linear shift, which we fit to the Ga­
V:Bi training data. We then verify the improved ac­
curacy of the MBA vs. the BA for a test data set of 
point defects in In-V:Bi. In addition, to test the trans­
ferability of the method to other systems that are not 
III-V semiconductors, the MBA was tested on a large,
recently published database of defect and impurity ener­
gies in CdX (X=S, Se, Te) materials [46]. Finally, the
MBA is used to predict the properties of the remaining
pair defects in In-V:Bi together with all defect properties
of Al-V:Bi materials. As a result, a large database of
formation energies and charge-state transition levels in
III-V:Bi materials is generated.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. 
Validation 
of first principles 
calculations 
In this section, we validate our first principles calculations of charge-state transition energies by comparing 
to available experimental and computed data. There is 
limited data for comparison on defect properties of dilute bismides and pure GaP and GaSb, but a significant 
amount for GaAs, so we focus on GaAs:Bi. DFT studies of GaAs:Bi by Luo et al. [47] using a very similar 
methodology to this work (see Sec. IV) are in an excellent 
agreement with the calculations performed here. The difference between our predicted point defect charge-state 
transition levels and those of Luo et al. have a MAE 
of 0.06 eV. Excellent agreement is also found between 
our calculated and the available point defect charge-state 
transition levels from experimental results, with a MAE 
of 0.04 eV, based on our best interpretation of the experimental data. This comparison is done for the same data 
and defect type and defect levels used in Luo et al. 
Calculations performed by Buckeridge et al. [48] for 
point defects in pure GaSb use a similar methodology to 
that used in this paper and are in very good agreement 
with our calculations, with differences in defect levels 
not exceeding 0.1 eV. The authors, similarly to us, find 
only qualitative agreement with the studies performed 
by Virkkala et al. [49] on GaSb. The quantitative disagreement can be attributed to differences in computational procedures, such as convergence criteria, treatment 
of spin-orbit interaction, and different approach used for 
the electrostatic corrections. 
The experimental observations of metastability of vacancy related defects in GaSb [50], and their theoretical 
predictions in GaAs [51], where in certain charge states 
instead of a single group III vacancy (vm), a pair antisite defect and group V vacancy is preferred, are also well 
reproduced in the current work. 
A careful investigation of Fig. 1 f), h), and i) reveals 
that some defects are stable in a negative (-1) charge state 
at EF = 0 eV. These defects are group III vacancies (in 
low band gap materials: 
GaSb, InAs and InSb) and a 
Gasb antisite. 
B. 
Insight from first principles 
calculations 
The calculated energies for the Ga-V:Bi systems can 
be used to better understand the experimental observations associated with III-V:Bi materials. They also allow 
us to make predictions about possible opportunities and 
challenges for improving the processing of III-V:Bi materials by mitigating the deleterious effect of defects. In 
the following we assume that higher stability of defects 
indicates these defects are present at higher concentrations (relative to less stable defects). This claim is certainly true at equilibrium but may not be true under 
the nonequilibrium growth conditions used for many of 
doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
these materials. 
In particular, III-V:Bi alloys are often 
grown using molecular beam epitaxy and metalorganic 
vapor phase epitaxy under conditions that are very far 
from equilibrium. However, we assume that even in these 
cases the chemical trends and qualitative features identified below are likely to be preserved. 
For the case of the isovalent doping (Biv ), low formation energy as well as a stable zero charge defect state 
with no charge-state transitions is desirable in terms 
of stably incorporating 
Bi to form an alloy. 
Figs. 1 
d)-f) show formation energies for point defects in GaV:Bi with chemical potentials corresponding to intermediate growth conditions (group III-rich and group V-rich 
conditions can be found in supplementary Figs. S2 and 
S8). The predicted formation energies for Biv follow the 
chemical trend of the mismatch between the group V 
and Bi atoms, with the highest formation energy for GaP 
and lowest for GaSb. This result is consistent with previous research on growth of these materials, where the 
most substantial amounts of Bi can be incorporated in 
GaSb, less Bi can be incorporated in GaAs, and a high 
Bi composition in GaP is most difficult to achieve. So 
far, GaSb:Bi layers and quantum wells with quite good 
optical properties were reported by Kopaczek et al. [52], 
Yue et al. [53] and Delorme et al. [54] while reports on 
optical properties of GaP:Bi are still very limited and not 
promising [55, 56]. This suggests that high-quality GaP 
material with Bi is difficult to achieve. 
Bi-related defects are very important for the optical 
quality of dilute bismides. In particular, materials can 
suffer from undesired antisite Bim defects. A high formation energy of those antisite defects is therefore preferable 
in order to manufacture a high-quality alloy. In p-type 
materials, the predicted BiGa defect formation energies 
are very low, close to zero (see Fig. 1 d)-f)). This is especially apparent under V-rich conditions, and in GaP and 
GaAs, where the formation energy of Bim is lower than 
that of Biv. The situation improves with the increase 
of Fermi level, where for n-type materials, BiGa always 
exhibits a higher formation energy than Biv. 
The binding energy of the Biv and BiGa defects in 
each system is the lowest of all nearest-neighbor-pairs 
and exhibits almost no change as a function of Fermi 
level (Fig. 2 d )-f)). This result suggests that no significant clustering between Biv and BiGa defects should be 
expected. The formation energies show that among the 
three Ga-V materials studied, GaSb:Bi (Fig. 1 f)), the 
material with the lowest mismatch between Bi and group 
V atom, exhibits the lowest formation energy for isovalent Biv doping and the highest energy for BiGa antisite 
under both III- and V-rich conditions. This suggests that 
GaSb:Bi might be the most promising for obtaining highquality (i.e. low defect concentration) materials. 
The binding energies show the influence of the mismatch between Bi atoms and the corresponding group 
V atoms very clearly. GaP:Bi and GaAs:Bi have a noticeable similarity in the shapes of the formation energy 
curves (Fig. 1) as well as the relative values of the binding

energies. Defects in these two materials span a similar 
range of stable charge states, with similar order of the 
formation energies between different defects. 
GaSb:Bi 
does not share this similarity. 
However, GaSb is the 
only material out of the three where the group V atom 
is larger than the group III atom, which results in different lattice-strain related effects for substitutional 
defects. GaSb:Bi is also the material with the lowest mismatch, due to the similar sizes and electronegativities of 
Sb and Bi, resulting in a Bi level with much larger separation from the valence band maximum (VBM) than 
the GaAs:Bi and GaP:Bi. This large separation, in turn, 
results in different electronic properties near the band 
gap edges, with significantly lower electron localization 
and narrower emission peaks, as well as reduced lattice 
strain in Bi-related defects. The reduced strain effects 
also encourage higher amounts of Bi to incorporate into 
the alloy. 
Fig. 2 shows binding energies of pair defects in GaV:Bi materials. P-type GaP:Bi and GaAs:Bi have a large 
(attractive) binding energy for nearest-neighbor-pair 
defect vaa+Biv, which involves a vacancy and an isovalent 
substitution of a smaller group V atom with larger Bi 
atom. A possible reason for this is that the strain induced by the Bi atom is partially relieved by the neighboring vacancy. The effect diminishes as the Fermi level 
increases due to the introduction of additional electrons, 
compensating for the missing electrons due to the vaPreprint

cancy. This compensation is directly connected with the 
decrease of the formation energy of VGa point defect in 
n-type materials. The same effect is not as pronounced 
in GaSb:Bi, where the strain effects resulting from size 
mismatch are small relative to GaAs and GaP, as discussed above. The very high attractive binding energy of 
vaa+Biv pairs in GaP:Bi and GaAs:Bi strongly suggests 
that unwanted Ga vacancies are more likely to be present 
when GaP and GaAs are grown with Bi atoms to form 
an alloy, compared to GaSb:Bi which again is predicted 
to have the lowest tendency to form unwanted defects. 
In the case of in-situ or ex-situ annealing, which is 
widely applied to HMAs, it can be expected that the 
formation/annihilation 
of point defects will be strongly 
influenced by formation energies as well as the kinetics of each defect type. 
Therefore, the possibility of 
clustering, which is very often suggested to occur in 
HMAs, including dilute bismides, is worth investigating. 
In the above discussion, we concluded that the 
Biv atom clustering tendencies in GaSb:Bi differs significantly from that in GaP:Bi and GaAs:Bi since the 
binding energy for vaa+Biv 
defect pairs in these alloys is much larger (i.e. attractive) 
than in GaSb:Bi, 
(Fig. 2). This conclusion is consistent with the experimental data reported so far for these alloys. For example, 
for GaAs:Bi a strong clustering upon annealing was reported in Refs. [57, 58] while a very homogeneous alloy 
was observed for GaSb:Bi [59, 60]. One of the pair defects, namely Biaa +vv was found to be unstable in all 
charge states - it undergoes a structure change to a more 
stable form of vaa+Biv. 
A similar situation is observed 
in the case of negatively charged Vaa+vv in GaP:Bi and 
GaAs:Bi, where a more stable VGa is observed. 
It is also interesting to note the fact that the binding energy curves as a function of Fermi energy are not always 
flat. This shows that in many cases the pair defects are

convex because the pair and corresponding point defects 
change stable charge states as a function of Fermi energy 
in different ways. 
Overall, the calculated database in this work provides 
significant insights into the behavior of defects in the GaV :Bi (as well as In-V:Bi and Al-V:Bi) systems. We expect that as more experimental data on defect levels in dilute bismides becomes available, particularly from DLTS, 
the present data will provide a valuable resource to aid 
in interpretation of experimental results, enhance understanding of III-V:Bi defect properties and, subsequently, 
aid in materials design and optimization. Additional details on results for the remaining In-V:Bi and Al-V:Bi 
systems obtained with the correction schemes described 
in Sec. II C can be found in Sec. II C 2.

Modified band alignment method 
The band alignment (BA) methods described in Methods section (Sec. IV B) have been used and tested in 
previous studies on a few select systems, and the mean 
absolute error between the values obtained with the BA 
correction and full HSE calculations has been found to 
be 0.24 eV and less than 0.2 eV in Refs. [40] and [39], 
respectively. However, in our case, the number of studied defect types and charge states is significantly larger 
than in previous studies. Here, we have 188 stable defect 
levels compared to around 20 and 55 in [40] and [39], respectively. This large number of defects allows for a more 
quantitative assessment of the method. The applicability 
of the method is apparent from comparing Figs. 3b) and 
e). In Fig. 3b), which shows the accuracy of LDA vs. 
HSE for charge state transition levels, a clear underestimation of the defect levels can be observed, with a mean 
error equal to the negative of the mean absolute error 
ME= -MAE= 
-0.439 eV. Fig. 3e) shows the LDA vs. 
HSE charge state transition levels after the BA correction, where the error statistics are much improved with 
MAE= 0.226 eV and ME= 0.18 eV. See Tab. I for easier 
comparison of error values. The BA results from Ref. [40] 
reveal that certain charge state transition levels, in particular those where the charge localization effects are not 
appropriately described within the local/semilocal functional [61], may show larger inaccuracies and in extreme 
cases be falsely determined to be unstable. 
A specific 
example where these errors might be particularly large is 
in defects with large Jahn-Teller distortions that require 
proper charge localization to capture in a quantitative 
manner. These situations are taken into account and are 
quantified by precision, recall and Fl scores, which carry 
information on the amount of misclassified defect levels 
and formation energies. These values are present on all 
charge-state transition level and formation energy parity 
plots. 
Although the BA provides a significant improvement, 
doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
reducing the mean error values by a factor of 2, the now 
positive value of the mean error indicates the correction 
overestimated a majority of the values. A visual inspection of Fig. 3e) reveals that the overestimation occurs 
mostly near the bottom of the band gap, while values at 
the top of the band gap seem to be more accurate, and 
that the overestimation is more severe for higher band 
gap materials. A similar behavior can be observed in Fig. 
2 in Ref. [39], where values near the bottom of the band 
gap tend to be overestimated after the BA correction. 
These trends suggest an opportunity for improvement of 
the BA correction scheme. In general, the behavior described above can be remedied by adding two band-gap 
dependent linear terms to the constant shift: 
Eforr =Ed+ Eshift + /3 ((1- 8)E9 - Ed). 
(1) 
This modified BA method (MBA) results in a shift dependent on the band gap of the material and on the position of a particular defect state within the gap. Such 
a correction is justified based on the trends apparent in 
Fig. 3e) and is clearly capable of improving the obtained 
charge-state transition levels for the data presented here 
(as can be seen in Fig. 3h)), although its physical interpretation is not obvious. The large number of defects 
and charge states calculated in this work with both LDA 
and HSE allows for an empirical determination of the /3 
and 8 parameters. 
In our case, all three Ga-V:Bi material systems have been used in determination of these 
parameters. 
Minimizing the RMSE for the general formula (Eq. 1) resulted in 8 = 0.05 and /3 = -0.14. Given 
that the value of 8 is so close to zero simply set it to zero, 
resulting in a simpler one parameter correction formula. 
With 8 set to zero, the minimization of RMSE resulted 
in an optimal value of /3 = -0.14 and only 1% reduction 
in RMSE. Further analysis of one- versus two-parameter 
formulas using Akaike information criterion [62] as well 
as Bayesian information criterion [63] shows that both 
criteria support the one-parameter, simplified equation. 
The MBA method with the optimized value of /3 and 
8 = 0 leads to a modest but significant improvement in 
the error statistics of defect levels vs. the BA, producing 
a MAE = 0.182 eV and ME = 0.001 eV, which is an 
improvement of about 19% (99%) for MAE (ME) relative to the original band alignment correction method, 
respectively. 
As mentioned in Sec. IVB, the BA correction on the 
defect levels can be projected to formation energies. As 
a result, BA with the use of Eq. 6 improves the accuracy 
of formation energies, reducing the error statistics from 
MAE= 
1.612 eV and ME = -1.538 eV for the uncorrected LDA vs. HSE, to MAE = 0.904 eV and ME = 
-0.89 eV. These values are calculated for the formation 
energies of stable charge states of defects at E F = 0 e V 
(i.e. the VBM, p-type condition), which are presented in 
Fig. 3a) and d) for uncorrected LDA vs. HSE and BA 
correction, respectively. The extent of the improvement 
provided by the projection (Eq. 6) is, however, limited 
by the inability of the correction to influence q = 0 charge

states. This results in a subsequent error in the q = 0 
charge state defect formation energies ( and, therefore, all 
other charged defect formation energies) in LDA as compared to HSE. This error is inherent to the LDA approach 
and may be partially due to the LDA inappropriate description of the band positions (and band gap underestimation). As a consequence, improper description of the 
change in the total energy associated with charge transfer due to charge density reorganization when defects are 
introduced. The physical mechanism of this behavior is 
complex and therefore it is not straightforward to fix with 
a simple physics-based correction. 
A similar procedure of projecting the corrected defect 
levels onto formation energies, although slightly more 
complex than that in BA, can be carried out for the 
MBA: 
Eforr[Xq] = Ef[Xq] + qEshift+ 
+ ,B(Ef[X 0] - Ef[Xq] - q(l - 8)E9 ) + "f. 
(2) 
The MBA expression for formation energies (Eq. 2) 
includes new, band gap-dependent, terms. This is a consequence of the new terms in the expression for the defect levels (Eq. 1) compared to BA (Eq. 5). However, 
despite the MBA providing an improvement over BA defect levels, it suffers from a similar problem as the BA 
correction in terms of inaccuracy when projected to formation energies. Therefore we propose an additional empirical correction to the MBA ('y term in Eq. 2), a constant shift based on the mean error of formation energies, 
which was determined to be"(= 
0.839 eV. This results 
in a significant improvement of error statistics of formation energies compared to BA, with MAE= 
0.37 eV, a 
59% improvement, and ME= 0 eV by construction. As 
before, these values are calculated for the formation energies of stable charge states of defects at E F = 0 e V, 
which are presented in Fig. 3g). Parity plots of formation energies for all defects and charge states, including 
the unstable ones, for all methods can be found in supplementary Fig. S10. It is worth noting, that although 
the MBA method is based on first principles calculations 
the newly introduced ,B and "( parameters are obtained 
empirically. 
Finally, as a consequence of the improved accuracy in 
formation energies and charge-state transition levels, errors in the binding energies of pair defects (panels c), f) 
and i) in Fig. 3) are also reduced. BA improves the LDA 
vs. HSE MAE= 1.312 eV and ME= -1.240 eV to MAE 
= 1.064 eV and ME= -1.064 eV. MBA further reduces 
the MAE to 0.489 eV and ME= 
-0.099 eV. 
It is interesting to note that for the direct LDA and 
BA the RMSE errors of the binding energies are much 
lower than expected by simply adding RMSE of formation energies in quadrature ( v'3 times the formation energy RMSE). This results implies that there is significant 
cancellation in the formation energy errors when these 
doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
energies are combined in the binding energies, as might 
be expected. However, this trend does not continue for 
the MBA. The MBA gives an RMSE = 0.499 for formation energy and RMSE = 0.780 eV for binding energy. 
The latter is very close to 0.499\/'3 = 0.864 eV, which is 
what would be expected by adding the formation energy 
errors in quadrature. 
This result demonstrates that after the MBA correction almost no cancellation of errors 
is obtained in taking the formation energies, supporting 
that the MBA has effectively used readily available error reduction information. 
It is worth mentioning that 
the binding energies, similarly to formation energies, are 
a function of Fermi energy. Parity plots correspond to 
EF = 0 eV and EF = E9 , but the same test performed 
at a different EF leads to similar error statistics. Finally, 
some outliers can be seen in the binding energy parity 
plots 3 c), f) and i). These are a consequence of the LDA 
(and, therefore, BA and MBA as well) occasionally being unable to predict a certain charge state transition as 
stable when compared to HSE. This has been discussed 
in more detail in [40] and in Sec. II C. As a consequence, 
in some instances, the binding energies of LDA, BA and 
MBA for one of the point defects or the pair defect are 
predicted to be in a different charge state than in HSE, 
leading to a larger error. 
The residuals (Fig. S11 c)), 
however, follow a reasonably normal distribution. 
In general, comparison of panels a)-c) with d)-f) and 
g)-i) in Fig. 3 shows that the MBA correction not only 
brings the results of a pure LDA approach close to the 
reference HSE functional values, but also improves upon 
the standard BA method, at the same time preserving 
the computational efficiency of LDA. This result shows 
that the HSE defect properties may be predicted reasonably accurately using the results of significantly faster 
but less accurate LDA methods. This use of two levels 
of accuracy in the modeling is sometimes called a multifidelity approach and has been previously used with success [46, 64, 65]. 
1. Method validation 
The MBA correction (Eqs. 1 and 2) is most useful if its 
parameters can be readily transferred to a new system. 
The ,Band"( (and 8 = 0) parameters in the MBA are fitted to the Ga-V:Bi systems, and not necessarily universal 
and transferable to other systems. In order to assess their 
transferability, a new database of single species point defects (i.e. no pair defects) was calculated for the In-V:Bi 
systems, yielding a set of 3 · 6 · 11 = 198 defect formation 
energies. The calculations used the exact same approach 
as in the Ga-V:Bi calculations and included both LDA 
and HSE values. The values of ,B = -0.14 and"(= 
0.839 
eV (and 8 = 0) optimized entirely on the Ga-V:Bi dataset 
were then used for a MBA correction of charge-state transition levels and defect formation energies of point defects 
in In-V:Bi. The corrected values were compared to the 
actual HSE results. The magnitude of the correction of

FIG. 3. Accuracy comparison of different approaches with hybrid functional (HSE) results on Ga-V:Bi dataset. 
First row: 
baseline LDA vs. HSE, second row: band alignment (BA) correction, third row: modified band alignment (MBA) correction. 
First column: formation energies of stable defects (precision and recall pertain to whether a defect in a certain charge state is 
predicted to be stable), second column: charge-state transition levels (precision and recall pertain to whether a charge-transition 
is properly predicted inside the band gap), third column: binding energies (precision and recall pertain to whether a binding 
energy is properly predicted as positive or negative). Red, blue and green points correspond to defects in GaP:Bi, GaAs:Bi, 
and GaSb:Bi respectively. 
our MBA method is scaled by the band gap, so it might 
be expected to be least effective for low band gap materials. Therefore, performing the validation on the low 
band gap In-V:Bi was chosen to assess a perhaps worst 
case scenario applicability of the method. Figs. 4b), e) 
and h) show defect level parity plots of HSE results with, 
respectively, LDA, LDA with BA correction, and LDA 
with MBA correction (Eq. 1, with /3 = -0.14 and o = 0). 
Similarly as in the case of Ga-V:Bi materials, the BA 
correction (panel e)) provides a significant improvement 
over the uncorrected values (panel b)), but exhibits an 
overestimation in the lower region of the band gap. This, 
in turn, is remedied by applying the MBA (panel h)), although due to the much lower band gaps of the In-V:Bi 
systems and therefore fewer stable defect levels, the effect is not as pronounced, and the main improvement is 
observed through the reduction in mean error. The final error values for the MBA are MAE= 0.175 eV and 
ME = -0.009 eV, which represent 50% and 97% improvement over the uncorrected values of MAE = ME = 
-0.35 eV. This result demonstrates that the empirically 
obtained /3 = -0.14 and o = 0 are transferable to this

system. Figs. 4a), d) and g) show formation energy of 
defects in stable charge-states at Ep = 0 eV parity plots 
of HSE results with, respectively, LDA, LDA with BA 
correction, and LDA with MBA correction (Eq. 2, with 
/3 = -0.14 and,= 
0.839 eV, (and 8 = 0)). Their analysis, again, reveals improvement of the error statistics 
for BA as compared to uncorrected values, and further 
improvement when MBA is used, confirming the transferability of, and /3. The final error values for the MBA are 
MAE= 
0.384 eV and ME= 
0.236 eV, which represent 
62% and 74% improvement over the uncorrected values 
of MAE= 
1.014 eV and ME= 0.905 eV. Parity plots of 
formation energies for all defects and charge states, including the unstable ones, can be found in supplementary 
Fig. 810. 
The In-V:Bi systems are likely to be quite similar with 
the Ga-V:Bi systems used to obtain the (3 and , values 
and therefore significant additional study in other materials families, e.g. II-VI systems, is needed to establish 
the general applicability of the MBA vs. BA method. In 
order to further demonstrate the applicability of MBA, 
we apply the method to a set of 656 PEE-calculated 
charge state transition levels of defects and impurities in 
CdX (X=S, Se, Te) reported by Mannodi-Kanakkithodi 
et al. [46], and compare them to the equivalent HSE values reported therein. As mentioned in Sec. IV, the BA 
and MBA methods are, in principle, applicable to semilocal functionals as well, therefore this test will assess not 
only the transferability of the method and its optimized 
parameters to other systems, but to other functionals as 
well. The resulting parity plots can be found in Figs. 4 c), 
f) and i). The MBA method (panel i)) again proved to be 
very efficient with MBA predicted values giving a MAE 
= 0.194 eV and ME= 
-0.006 eV vs HSE values. This 
represents an improvement of 16% and 96% compared to 
the MAE = 0.230 eV and ME = 0.137 eV obtained with 
pure BA and an improvement of 55% and 99% over the 
uncorrected defect levels with MAE= 0.427 eV and ME 
= -0.415 eV. The work in Ref. [46] allows us to make 
a direct and independent comparison between the MBA 
and machine learning (ML) methods. Ref. [46] provides 
a ML model for predicting defect level values as close as 
possible to HSE from input features that include elemental properties and PBE defect levels. We can therefore 
compare the errors from the MBA and the ML model 
where both have the full PBE defect information available. We note that all the data sets in Ref. [46] include 
charge states outside the gap, which were not used in the 
optimization of our present MBA model. Ref. [46] obtained a RMSE = 0.24 eV with their best average ML 
model (Random Forest Regression - RFR) on a 10% left 
out test set from their main training data. To compare 
to this, we use the MBA to predict their main data set 
(including the test set) split into 10 folds, to obtain an 
average and standard deviation RMSE = 0.240±0.035 eV 
(Fig. 812 c)). We also compare to their predictions on an 
out-of-sample test comprised of data on two new systems 
not directly in their training space (CdTeo_5Seo.5 and 
doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
CdSe0.580.5 ). On this data, the ML model in Ref. [46] 
obtained a RMSE = 0.235 eV and the MBA obtained a 
RMSE = 0.267 eV (Fig. 812 f)). The MBA RMSEs for 
the out of sample test set are around 13% worse than 
the ML model, which is statistically significant, but the 
MBA provides a much simpler approach, with just one 
fitting parameter for defect levels that appears to be quite 
transferable. Additionally, it is important to notice that 
even though the MBA was optimized on LDA calculated 
values, the optimized parameters also apply to the PBE, 
and it is expected that they should apply to other semilocal functionals as well. All of the error statistic values are 
gathered in Tab. I. 
The 
CdX 
(X=S,Se,Te) 
results 
from 
MannodiKanakkithodi 
et al. [46] were the only large readily 
available database for defect levels calculated with both 
hybrid and local/semi-local functional, which is necessary to critically assess the transferability of the MBA 
method. 
Furthermore, this database shared many features with ours, including the same crystal structure and 
similar methods of calculations ( e.g. the same supercell size, DFT code and electrostatic correction), providing perhaps near optimal condition for transferability 
of our MBA. We have performed some more limited but 
more demanding testing for transferability with the much 
smaller set of data reported in [39] and [40]. The results 
are shown in supplementary Fig. 814. The MBA for 
dataset from Ref. [39] shows an improvement of 20% in 
MAE over the regular BA, however the parameters need 
to be reoptimized, and both /3 and 8 need to be utilized. 
The MBA method used on, another smaller dataset, reported in [40], results in an improvement in MAE of 8% 
over the regular BA with the parameters reoptimized. 
Both of these smaller datasets are, however, performed 
on larger supercells, in systems of different crystal structure and chemistry and with slightly different computational methods, which is potentially the reason why the 
reoptimization is necessary. 
Although the need to re--
optimize parameters may make the method more time 
consuming to apply in some cases, analysis performed 
on our main dataset (Ga-V:Bi systems) shows that using 
as few as 10 points for reoptimization produces results 
that already show noticeable improvement over the regular band alignment method. 
Supplementary Fig. 815 
shows the MAE as a function of the number of points 
used in parameter optimization. 
The rapid convergence 
of the fitting means that the MBA can be refit with very 
modest amounts of data. 
These validation tests show 
that the modified band alignment method does improve 
the results of the regular band alignment approach in all 
cases studied here, and those cover a wide variety of different systems of different chemistry and different computational approaches, which suggests that the method 
is likely to be widely applicable. However, the parameters may need to be reoptimized for different unit cell 
sizes and crystal structures than those that were used in 
this study or in Ref. [46]. For calculations similar to 
those performed here or in the CdS study [46] our MBA

Red, blue and green points correspond to defects in InP:Bi, InAs:Bi, and InSb:Bi (CdS, CdSe, CdTe) respectively. Grey and 
yellow are CdSSe and CdSeTe alloys. 
correction with /3 = -0.14 and 'Y = 0.839 eV (and t5 = 0) 
may be applied directly to modify the regular band alignment method and provide a quick path to increasing the 
fidelity of LDA or GGA defect levels and formation energies to approach HSE accuracy. 
2. 
Application of the method to new systems 
After demonstrating that the MBA is an effective correction of defect properties ( see Sec. II C 1), the MBA was 
subsequently used to obtain defect properties of the remaining (pair) defects in the In-V:Bi family of materials 
as well as all 27 defect types in Al-V:Bi. These predictions, combined with the directly calculated HSE results 
for Ga-V:Bi and point defects in In-V:Bi resulted in a 
large database of 2673 defect formation energies. These 
systems are all naturally zincblende III-V semiconductors which are technologically relevant for optoelectronic 
applications. The calculated values included the formation energies, binding energies, and defect chargeastate 
transition levels. Due to the mixed direct HSE DFT

and LDA + MBA correction approaches in tables and figures, MBA results are marked with an asterisk. Tables II 
and III include the MBA defect levels for In-V:Bi materials alongside the directly HSE-calculated Ga-V:Bi, while 
the MBA values for Al-V:Bi can be found in Sec. VIA, 
Tab. SIi). The MBA binding energies for ln-V:Bi and AlV:Bi are present in Figs. 6 and 5 respectively. Point defect formation energies are collected in one figure together 
with the directly calculated values in Fig. 1. Due to the 
large amount of calculated data, only point defect formation energies in intermediate conditions together with 
binding energies are presented here. The formation energies of pair defects can be estimated from the binding 
energies, or can be found in the supplementary material 
(Sec. VI A, Figs. 81-89) for both group III and group V 
rich conditions, as well as intermediate ones. 
The chemical trends observed in the results of the predicted values for In-V:Bi and Al-V:Bi materials are generally analogous to the trends observed for the directly 
calculated values for Ga-V:Bi, discussed in Sec. IL Point 
defect formation energies exhibit similar trends with mismatch, with the most encouraging properties visible for 
III-Sb:Bi. The differences in group III and Bi atoms size, 
although less prominent, are also visible in the chemical 
trends but do not influence the general conclusions, apart 
from the fact that Biv charge-transition transition levels 
are visible above the VBM for all Al-V:Bi materials. The 
main differences visible in the shape of the formation energies and binding energies come from the large difference 
in the band gaps between Al and In based materials. 
The results of all calculations can be found in VI B. 
D. 
Machine 
learning model exploration 
Recent studies on machine learning (ML) for impurities in Cd based chalcogenides [46] showed that ML 
can be a powerful tool for efficient predictions of defect 
properties based not only on the results of less expensive 
semi-local functionals, but even just elemental properties 
of the impurities, greatly reducing the effective computational cost. The notable success of the relatively simple 
BA and MBA methods suggests that a simple relation0.498

ship might exist between the LDA and HSE defect energetics which could be effectively captured with machine 
learning. To explore this hypothesis, we consider the regression problem of fitting F in Y = F(X), where the 
target Y are the HSE defect formation energies and features X are data we can obtain from LDA. Note that 
the X data could be just defect formation energies, but 
we could include some other features that come at no extra computational cost from the LDA calculations. Tools 
used in the machine learning are described in Sec. IV D. 
The X features used in the regression included the formation energy, charge state, band gap, FNV charge interaction correction, total energy, and results of Bader analysis 
(which captures aspects of localization effects). We first 
considered linear multivariable regression, which revealed 
the charge state and the formation energy to have by far 
the highest coefficients. This result suggested that the 
band alignment shift is the major factor in the discrepancy between HSE and LDA results. 
Consistent with 
this result, the validation on In-V:Bi test data, equivalent to that in Fig. 4, resulted in statistics very similar 
to those of the MBA method. 
Second, in order to try 
more complex nonlinear methods, other machine learning approaches were optimized to yield the lowest leavesystem-out cross validation (CV) MAE. Neural networks 
yielded the most promising results. After a modest effort 
of testing the number of layers and nodes, a neural network of 3 layers with 128, 64, and 32 nodes was found to 
be fairly optimal. As a result of leave-system-out CV, the 
obtained error statistics were ME = 0.04 eV and MAE 
= 0.195 eV for the defect levels and ME= -0.115 eV and 
MAE= 0.343 eV for the formation energies. Random 5fold CV yielded only marginally better error statistics. 
Supplementary figure Fig. 813 shows parity plots of the 
results of the leave-system-out CV of the model vs. HSE 
results of formation energies and defect levels. The result 
is not noticeably better than the MBA method (Fig. 3 
g), h)), but required a much more computationally 
intensive machine learning algorithm and training on both 
HSE and LDA datasets, making the method much less 
accessible and more difficult to apply. Additionally, due 
to simplicity and being more physics-based, MBA is expected to be much more transferable to new systems.

a)-c), d)-f), and g)-i) correspond to AlP:Bi, AlAs:Bi, and AlSb:Bi respectively. The asterisk indicates that the results were 
obtained with LDA corrected with the modified band alignment correction (MBA). 
Therefore, based on the results obtained here as well as 
the trends of local/semilocal defect levels vs. HSE observed in Refs. [39, 40, 46], we believe that the MBA 
method may be the most practical approach. 
It is worth to notice that in case of impurities, as demonstrated in [46, 66], ML methods may be able to provide 
approximate description of defect levels and formation 
energies solely from elemental properties. 
However, for 
the present study which focuses mostly on intrinsic defects, such type of ML model was not possible to explore. 
III. 
SUMMARY 
In this work, we provide a comprehensive, 
selfconsistent database of defect formation energies, chargestate transition levels and binding energies for point and 
pair defects using state-of-the-art 
ab initio methods. The 
computed database covers all zincblende III-V diluted 
bismides, which are technologically relevant for a number of optoelectronic applications. 
Based on the obtained results, band alignment and machine learning approaches are investigated to obtain hybrid functional accuracy defect formation energies and defect levels from 
more inexpensive functionals. A new method of correcting results of computationally 
inexpensive functionals, 
the modified band alignment, is proposed and assessed 
in detail. 
This research provides valuable information 
for a range of materials research modalities. 
The large 
database can aid experimental researchers in identification of defects observed in experimental measurements 
and provide rational strategies to tune the defect properties of a material. 
The large amount of data can be 
directly used by the materials informatics community to 
design, build and assess new machine learning models 
for more quantitative prediction of defect properties and 
understanding of chemical trends in a range of semiconductor systems. 
Finally, the modified band alignment 
method proposed here is directly useful for computational researchers conducting atomistic simulations of dePreprint

feet properties. The method enables prediction of defect 
formation energies and charge state transition levels with 
accuracy approaching that of hybrid HSE functionals but 
at the computational expense of LDA/GGA calculations. 
Our proposed method has been thoroughly verified on 
our own tests, as well as on defect data for an entirely 
different family of materials obtained from a separate 
study. The modified band alignment method not only 
allows for fast evaluation of defect properties, but also 
opens up new opportunities for high-throughput calculations of defect and related properties in other systems.

METHODS 
A. 
Defect properties 
For each material, 27 different types of defects were 
studied. 
6 point defects: 
Birn, Biv, vrn, vv, Illv, 
Vrn, and 21 pair defects (the defects are described in 
Kroger-Vink notation where III and V refer to elements 
from these columns of periodic table, and v refers to vacancies). 
The pair defects included all possibilities of 
nearest- and second-nearest-neighbor 
pairs of point defects. Charges ranging from -5 to 5 were analyzed. As 
no defects of charge -5 (5) were found to be stable, no 
higher charged defects were investigated. 
The formation energy of a defect X with a charge q 
added to the computational 
unit cell as a function of 
Fermi level EF in the band gap was calculated according 
to the formula: 
(3) 
where Et 0t[Xq] is the total energy of the supercell with 
the defect, Et 0 t[pure] is the total energy of the corresponding pure (undefected) supercell, ni is the number 
of added (ni > 0) or removed (ni < 0) atoms, µi is the 
chemical potential of the species i, EvBM [pure] is the

energy of the valence band maximum of the pure material and Ecorr is the energy correction that compensates 
for the electrostatic interactions arising from the periodic 
image of the defect. The Freysoldt, Neugebauer and Van 
de Walle (FNV) correction [67, 68] was used to account 
for the electrostatic interaction. 
For pair defects XYq comprised of point defects Xq 
and yq, the binding energy was evaluated according to: 
Eb(EF) = E 1[xqx](EF)+E
1[Yqy](EF)-E
1[XYQXY](EF) 
(4) 
where qx, qy and qxy correspond to the charge state of 
the particular defect with the lowest formation energy at 
the chosen Fermi level. Positive values of binding energy 
indicate an energetic preference of the defects forming as 
a pair rather than separately. 
A stable charge state is define by the lowest formation energy Ef [Xq] ( E F) at a given Fermi level E F · The energies 
at which the resultant curve changes slope (intersections 
of Ef[Xq](EF) 
lines) are the charge state transition (defect) levels, Ed, 
It is worthwhile to mention here that the Biv is an isovalent dopant, which is usually not treated as a defect. 
However, since it may influence the electronic structure 
and have a similar physical effect on the system as other 
defects, treating it as such in this work provides a much 
more convenient way of comparing and presenting the 
results. 
B. 
Band alignment 
based correction 
of LDA results 
One of the most efficient and at the same time computationally inexpensive methods of correcting the LDA results of charge-state transition levels (and, consequently, 
formation energies) is the band alignment correction family of methods [39-45]. In these methods, a common 
reference for the charge-state transition levels is established and allows one to align the band edges between the 
semilocal/local and hybrid functional calculations. Over 
the years, a number of different approaches have been 
used: Ref. [39] used local ionic potential as a reference, 
Ref. [41] used a deep 2s atomic level, Ref. [40] utilized 
slab calculations to allow the use of vacuum as a reference, and Refs. [42-45] used the average electrostatic potential. In this work, we adopt the last approach, where 
the alignment is obtained from the average electrostatic 
potential. The main advantage of this method is its simplicity and the requirement of only one HSE calculation 
on the primitive unit cell of the undefected system, effectively making the correction quick and easy to apply. 
Although the band gaps calculated within LDA or GGA 
and HSE differ significantly, the geometry of the primitive unit cell calculated within LDA or GGA and HSE 
are often similar, which is also true in the case of materials studied in this work. Therefore, we assume that 
the structural differences have negligibly small impact on 
the electronic densities which is necessary for the method 
doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
to succeed [42]. This allows for the method to be used 
on fully self-consistent LDA or GGA calculations and 
validated against independent fully self-consistent HSE 
results. 
In practice, in this work, the band alignment 
is obtained by first calculating the electronic structure 
and electrostatic potential of the pure material with both 
LDA and HSE, and then calculating the difference between the averaged electrostatic potentials (band alignment shift, EshiJt)-
The value is then added to the LDA 
charge state transition levels (the band edges are aligned 
according to the average electrostatic potentials). 
This 
results in a constant shift of those levels on the energy 
scale. 
(5) 
where Ed is the LDA defect level. It is worth noting 
that the underestimated value of the LDA band gap is 
also corrected in this method and the systems are analyzed and interpreted within the correct, and appropriately aligned, HSE band gap. After the alignment the 
defect levels are referenced to the VBM of the corrected 
band gap. A shift of a charge-state transition level, i.e. 
the intersection of two Ef (EF) (Eq. 3) lines associated 
with two charge states, may be interpreted as shifts of the 
Ef (EF = 0) formation energy levels of those two charge 
states. 
Therefore, correction associated with the band 
alignment shift of the defect levels can be projected onto 
the formation energies, resulting in a charge-dependent 
correction of the Ef (EF = 0) formation energies. 
(6) 
There is, however, a fundamental limitation of this approach to obtaining corrected formation energies. The 
projection of band alignment correction on the formation 
energies is charge dependent and, therefore, provides no 
correction for charge q = 0. Although the band alignment projection does significantly improve the accuracy 
of the formation energies as can be seen by comparing 
Figs. 3 a) and d), there is still a clear but consistent 
underestimation, associated with the inability of the correction to affect q = 0 formation energies. 
C. 
First principles 
calculations 
Calculations were performed using density-functional 
theory [69] as implemented in the VASP code [70, 71], and 
with plane-augmented wave (PAW) potentials [72] with 
s2pl and s2p3 valence electron configuration for group 
III and V atoms respectively, with the exception of Bi 
atoms where, due to its large size, d electrons were additionally included. A 64 atom supercell was used, which is 
a 2 x 2 x 2 multiplication of a conventional zincblende unit 
cell. Convergence studies on GaAsBi [47] have shown 
that for a -3 charge state this choice of supercell, when 
Preprint

used in conjunction with the FNV electrostatic correction scheme, leads to an error in formation energies of 
up to 0.16 eV when compared to a large, 512 atom unit 
cell. For defect levels, additional tests we performed here 
led to an estimated error of using 64 atom unit cells not 
exceeding 0.16 eV (See Fig. S16, where a convergence of 
defect levels with respect to unit cell size for v As in GaAs 
for charge states ranging from Oto -4 is presented). It is 
important to notice that very few defects for the systems 
studied here are stable in charge states higher than + - 3 
(less than 5%), and the majority of stable states are in the 
±2 range. Considering the computational cost required 
for the large number of calculations and the HSE hybrid 
functional [73], which has been used for both the geometry optimization and the total energy calculations, the 64 
atom unit cell has been chosen as a compromise between 
computational cost and accuracy. In addition, the use 
of 64 atom unit cell allowed for consistency in the additional verification on CdX systems from Ref. [46], which 
were obtained on 64 atom supercells as well. The internal 
atomic degrees of freedom were optimized for each defect 
and each charge state to allow the possibility of different relaxations, including Jahn-Teller distortions. 
The 
use of the HSE functional was deemed necessary for a 
number of reasons: first, to reproduce the intricate electron density of charged structures as accurately as possible, second, to get an accurate value of the total energy, 
and finally to provide a correct description of the band 
structure and the band gap value in particular. 
The a 
in the HSE was used as a free parameter to fine-tune 
the obtained value of the band gap for pure parent GaP, 
GaAs and GaSb compounds, where slight adjustments 
provided an excellent agreement of band gaps and lattice parameters with those of OK experimental values. 
The values of the a parameter used for each material together with the resulting band gaps, lattice parameters 
and Eshift values used in Eqs. 1, 2, 5 and 6 have been 
summarized in supplementary Table SI. All defect calculations were performed with the optimized a values for 
each material. 
Convergence studies and assessment of 
the required computational resources resulted in a choice 
of 2 x 2 x 2 Monkhorst-Pack mesh [74]. An energy cutoff of 350 eV (1.35 times the recommended value in the 
POTCAR of the hardest atom) was used, and the total energy within each SCF cycle was converged to 0.1 
meV. The optimization procedure was carried out until 
none of the forces exceeded 0.005 eV / A. Due to the large 
mass of Bi and in order to properly reproduce the band 
structure ( the band gap in particular), 
all calculations 
were performed with spin-orbit coupling included. It has 
been shown that the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has 
significant influence on the electronic structure as well 
as on formation energies [47] in GaAs:Bi and the same 
is expected for other systems studied here. In all cases, 
the magnetic moments were optimized from initial values 
of mx = my = mz = 1 Bohr magneton per atom with 
the assumption that the most stable spin state would be 
found through optimization. Due to the large scale of the 
doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.124601 
study it was not feasible to explicitly study all possible 
spin states for all defects, however, since the typical spin 
polarization energies for similar systems ( specifically, vacancies in other similar III-V systems), of present at all, 
are in the order of tens of meV [75], the error would be 
negligible. 
The shortcoming of the periodic approach to charged 
defect calculations, specifically, the problem of the electrostatic interaction between the artificially high concentration of defects created by the periodic images of the 
defects [76], was overcome by the use of the Freydsoldt 
(FNV) method [67, 68]. The correction was calculated 
via the alignment of the local potentials of defected and 
pure structures with the use of the sxdefectalign 
code, 
an add-on to the SPXInX repository. To keep the results 
consistent throughout the large number of cases studied 
the alignment region of the potential was kept consisten~ 
throughout all the structures and types of defects. The 
region was chosen as 30% of the area of the potential 
in the middle between the periodic images of the defect 
from which an average value was calculated and use<l 
in the alignment procedure. Dielectric constants are required for proper description of screening properties in 
the determination 
of the electrostatic correction. 
Out 
of convenience and due to their wide availability for a 
large number of semiconductor materials, experimental 
values of dielectric constants were used. Those values 
were taken from Ref. [77]. For unknown systems, however, our tests have shown an LOA-calculated dielectric 
constants should yield satisfactory results of the electrostatic correction, with the difference between the energy 
correction calculated with experimental and LDA dielectric constant not exceeding 10% for a + /-1 charge. The 
chemical potentials have been calculated for each element 
as a total energy per atom in their corresponding lowest 
energy cr)'._stal structures, i.e. Cmca for Ga, 14/mmm for 
In, and R3m for all group V elements except phosphorus 
which according to both our calculations and Ref. [78j 
has an equilibrium structure of P2/c. 
The calculation 
parameters for chemical potentials were kept consistent 
with the parameters for calculation of formation energies. 
In the case of HSE, a values corresponding to that used 
for the host material were used for calculation of chemical 
potentials. This was done in order to stay consistent and 
take advantage of potential error cancellation. Although 
hybrid functionals are not necessarily the most accurate 
for calculating cohesive energy of metals, they still tend 
to perform well [73]. The obtained chemical potentials 
were used in the calculation of defect formation energies 
which have been evaluated in III-rich and V-rich condi~ 
tions (upper and lower bounds). For III-rich conditions, 
µ V was obtained with the use of the DFT values of µI I I 
and µ(II I- V) and for V-rich, µI I I was calculated respectively with the DFT values of µV and µ(III-V), 
in both 
cases utilizing the relation µIII+ 
µV = µ(III-V). 
Intermediate conditions correspond to chemical potentials 
calculated as an average between III- and V-rich values. 
Values of all used chemical potentials can be found in
