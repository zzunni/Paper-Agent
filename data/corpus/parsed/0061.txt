Abstract 
Soaring demands of multi-stacked memory devices request urgent development of backside 
contact electrode technologies, such as high aspect ratio etching, metallization, and inspection 
methods. Especially the complex metal contact process should be monitored for each 
manufacturing step to filter the defective samples and to maintain the high yield of production. 
Among the inspection methods for detecting the electrical connections, there is voltage contrast 
(VC)-SEM and conducting AFM (C-AFM). In this report, we investigated the two inspection 
methods for testing designed samples with different contact hole states. The VC-SEM data 
shows the contrast variation at the contact holes, from which one may discern the contact status 
with an optimum voltage. The C-AFM results clearly demonstrate a finite electrical current in 
the connected contact, while a negligible current in the disconnected one. Finally, we discuss 
insights of using the two methods for analyzing the contact hole technologies with high aspect 
ratios.

Introduction 
Our daily lives are heavily intertwined with electronic devices that rely extensively on 
advanced semiconductor technologies, including smartphones, high-speed networks, cloud 
computing, and artificial intelligence computing [1]. These technologies have been made 
possible by the continuous scaling of key device components [2], with critical dimensions 
reaching a few nanometers in recent years. Thanks to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography 
and advanced fabrication technologies [3,4], the lateral dimensions of individual devices now 
approach the nanoscale. In the pursuit of high-density memories, such as dynamic random 
access memory (DRAM), vertical NAND (V-NAND) flash memory, and resistive switching 
memory, multi-stacking technologies have become increasingly important [2,5–10]. These 
multi-stacking approaches necessitate electrical contacts with a high aspect ratio, particularly 
for backside electrical patterns. Advancements in etching and deposition methods are required 
to fabricate 3D structures with high aspect ratios, such as 30 for 32-story-tall structures [11]. 
During the fabrication processes, it is crucial to validate the electrical connection states, 
distinguishing between the connected condition (open, 'OP') and the disconnected condition 
(not open, 'NO'), by developing appropriate inspection methodologies. Both speed and 
precision are key factors for these inspections, as they contribute to enhancing productivity in 
wafer-scale manufacturing processes. 
Various advanced inspection techniques have been explored to test 3D contact holes with high

aspect ratios. Electron-based methods, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [11], 
critical dimension-scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) [12,13], and voltage contrastSEM (VC-SEM) [14–16], have been widely developed due to their small beam size and 
chemical sensitivity, although they require a vacuum environment. Photon-based 
methodologies, such as ellipsometry [17] and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [18,19], 
offer increased sensitivity to diffraction in regularly patterned nanocurie structures. Scanning 
probe methods, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and conducting AFM (C-AFM) [20–
23], have emerged as tools for monitoring both topographic and electrical characteristics. These 
physical probes not only enable topographic inspections but also facilitate active manipulation 
of nanostructures at scales as small as a few nanometers. However, it is crucial to compare the 
characteristics of different analytical techniques using similar practical sample structures in 
order to advance measurement and analysis techniques. Such comparisons can pave the way 
for developing complementary approaches in the field of nanoscale pattern technology for the 
next generation. 
Here, we conducted an investigation of two examination methods, namely VC-SEM and CAFM, to assess the electrical connectivity of contact holes in specially prepared test samples. 
The VC-SEM measurements revealed notable voltage-dependent electron emissions, allowing 
for effective differentiation between the OP and NO geometries. Fine-tuning of the beam 
voltage was necessary to achieve optimal distinction for specific materials. On the other hand, 
the C-AFM tests clearly distinguished current maps between the OP and NO geometries, even 
when their topographies appeared identical. Finally, we provide insights into the analysis of 
contact hole states in realistic test samples based on our findings.

Experimental 
We deposited thick SiO2 on a Si substrate using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(PECVD) to model the realistic device structure with deep holes. On the SiO2 layer, a hard 
mask of amorphous carbon layer (1500 nm)/SiON layer (100 nm) was deposited. Then, contact 
holes were patterned using photolithography with a KrF scanner (S203B, Nikon). The etching 
of contact holes and masks was conducted using a dry etcher (SCCM, Tokyo Electron Ltd.). 
The etching process was intentionally stopped with residual SiO2 layers left at the bottom of 
contact holes to make the electrically floated sample (NO). The thickness of the residual SiO2 
was about 100 nm. After the etching of the hole, TiN (10 nm)/W (500 nm) was deposited. TiN 
was deposited by sputtering (ENDURA-5500, AMAT), and W was deposited by chemical 
vapor deposition. TiN was selected as a diffusion barrier layer between the Si and W layer 
along with its superior adhesion property and low contact resistance. Then, chemical 
mechanical polishing (CMP) was performed to flatten the surface and remove the excess W 
layer. VC-SEM images were obtained with a Hitachi SU-8230 field-emission SEM. We varied 
the accelerating voltage from 1 kV to 6.5 kV. The beam current was set to 10 μA. Operating 
distance was 8–9 mm. Topography and current mapping images were obtained by using AFM 
(XE-100, Park systems). We used a ElectriMulti75-G rotated-shape tip from BudgetSensors 
with a radius of 25 nm and a height of 17 μm. We estimated the contact resistance below 1 Ω. 
We used a preamplifier embedded in the AFM system. A voltage of 2 V was applied to the 
probe tip. Images were taken with a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels and the scan speed of 1 Hz.

contact hole structures. Two kinds of contact hole geometries in the test samples were prepared 
with connected (OP) and floated (NO) electrical contacts between the W plugs and the Si 
substrates. Such different electrical connections make the test samples suitable for the 
investigations of VC-SEM. For the VC-SEM measurements, a scattered amount of electron 
beam flux was monitored in terms of the acceleration voltage of the electron beam. In the 
following, we investigated a detailed comparison of the two different electrical contact states 
in the test samples. 
 
Fig. 1. VC-SEM measurements for the variation of the secondary electron as a function of 
acceleration voltages. At a certain voltage, the NO electrode shows the same contrast to the 
side dielectric region (blue profile), while the OP electrode shows depressed contrast (red 
profile).  
 
Initially, we employed the VC-SEM technique to examine contact hole failure. VC-SEM 
measures the intensity of the secondary electrons while adjusting the accelerating voltage of 
the primary electron beam at a constant current (Fig. 1). During this process, there is a partial

compensation between the incoming primary electrons and the outgoing secondary electrons, 
leading to both positive and negative charging on the surface of the sample. The acceleration 
voltage of the electron beam has the greatest impact on the charging type, which is also 
influenced by factors such as the primary beam current, sample material, surface topography, 
and other variables [14]. Although the surface potential can be modulated by applying a bias 
voltage to the samples, we focus on the grounded sample configuration in this study. 
Subsequently, the accumulated charges in the dielectric region and the floated W region have 
distinct effects on the secondary electron signal compared to the connected W region. 
Leveraging these distinctions, it is possible to identify the optimal range of accelerating 
voltages that yield the most effective contrast between the OP and NO samples.  
Fig. 2(a) and (b) illustrate two sets of VC-SEM images showcasing different acceleration 
voltages for both the OP and NO samples, respectively. Each SEM image exhibits four contact 
holes filled with W electrodes, surrounded by SiO2 dielectric areas. As the voltages increase, 
gradual darkening and brightening of the electrode areas can be observed. However, the 
contrast variation is more pronounced in the OP sample, particularly in the 3.5–5.5 kV range, 
compared to the NO sample. Additionally, the contrast variation is less prominent in the side 
dielectric regions for both samples. This can be attributed to the accumulation of positive 
charges on the surfaces of the dielectric regions and the floated W electrode regions, which 
suppresses the emission of negative electrons. 
For a qualitative analysis, we extracted the secondary electron signal as a function of the 
applied voltage. Fig. 2(c) displays the profile plots of secondary electron intensity for the OP 
sample (red) and the NO sample (blue) along the dashed lines traversing their contact 
electrodes. As the acceleration voltage increases from 1.0 kV to 6.5 kV, the secondary electron 
intensity at the electrode area of the OP sample initially decreases, reaches a minimum intensity

at 4.5 kV, and then increases. Conversely, the electrode of the NO sample exhibits higher 
intensities across the entire voltage range compared to the OP sample. It is worth noting that 
there is minimal intensity variation in the side SiO2 area for both samples. To enhance the 
discrimination efficiency between the OP and NO samples, the condition of 3.5 kV can be 
chosen, where the secondary electron intensity is nearly identical to the surroundings for the 
NO sample. Subsequently, by simply examining whether the electrode area displays suppressed 
intensity, one can determine the electrical connectivity. Thus, VC-SEM proves to be a valuable 
tool for identifying the electrical connection states of contact hole electrodes, given the tuned 
voltage dependence of relative contrast for the specific materials involved.

electrode and the surrounding is minimal for the NO sample, while that of the OP sample is 
quite significant. Note that the surrounding areas show only a small contrast variation  
 
 
Fig. 3. C-AFM measurements of local current densities, which are sharply varied depending 
on the contact state of electrodes. Inset images indicate current maps for several contact hole 
geometries. 
 
Detection of contact hole failure can also be achieved using C-AFM by measuring the electrical 
current at the surface, as depicted in Fig. 3. In the OP sample, if a W plug is connected to the 
bottom Si substrate, an electrical current will flow from the Si substrate to the metal-coated CAFM tips. Conversely, for the floated contact state, the electrical current should be negligible, 
making it indistinguishable from the dielectric side region. Fig. 4 presents both height and 
current maps for contact holes of different sizes (1.0 and 0.5 𝜇m). As the surfaces were flattened 
using the CMP procedure, the W-filled area appears to be sunken by approximately 40 nm due 
to the varying polishing rates of W and SiO2. In other words, the topographic images, as 
indicated by the black curves in the insets, do not differentiate between the OP and NO samples

based on the height profiles, regardless of the hole sizes. 
Fig. 4 illustrates the current maps (shown in orange), which exhibit a noticeable contrast 
between the two contact states. In the OP samples, the electrode areas of both contact sizes 
display similar current values, indicating uniformity. This consistency is further supported by 
the current profile curves (depicted in red) in the insets. The presence of a non-zero current 
signal precisely aligns with the locations of the topographic dips, providing direct evidence of 
both surface structure and electrical conductivity. Conversely, the NO samples exhibit 
negligible current values across the entire sample area. The disconnected electrode fails to 
transmit any electrical current, which is consistent with the surrounding dielectric region. 
Therefore, this comparison serves as unambiguous evidence of how C-AFM examinations 
effectively differentiate between distinct contact hole states in these model geometries.

structures depending on the contact hole states. The insets of the topographic maps show line 
profiles of height (black) and current (red) values along the dashed lines in the corresponding 
maps. The inset of (b) displays sharp jump in the expanded current profile near the perimeter 
of contact hole. The sizes of the holes were 1.0 μm (a, c) and 0.5 μm (b, d).  
 
Our findings provide a direct comparison between two competing methodologies, employing 
meticulously prepared realistic sample geometries. We further discuss the advantages and 
limitations of these methodologies for their application in contact hole monitoring procedures. 
At first glance, VC-SEM appears to be a faster method compared to C-AFM, as the electron 
beam scanning is quicker than physically probing with tips. However, it is important to note 
that VC-SEM requires delicate tuning to optimize the secondary electron contrast based on the 
specific materials and geometries involved. Furthermore, it is crucial to handle surface charging 
effects effectively in the high vacuum environment, especially when the test samples are not 
coated with additional metallic layers. In the case of small contact holes, the dielectric region 
surrounding them can induce significant surface charging phenomena. This is also why we 
demonstrated VC-SEM monitoring using relatively large contact hole diameters, such as 40 
𝜇m. Considering all these factors, it is important to note that VC-SEM may necessitate a longer 
probing duration compared to regular SEM scans. This highlights the need for other 
complementary methodologies that offer ambient compatibility and nanometer resolution. 
On the other hand, the results from C-AFM demonstrate a clear capability for classification 
when applied to the model samples. The bi-functional monitoring of both height and current 
values proves advantageous for inspection applications. In the inset of Fig. 4(b), the expanded 
current profile reveals a sharp current jump within the nanometer-scale range at the perimeter

of the contact hole. It is noteworthy that the C-AFM, with its ambient application and 
nanometer-scale lateral resolution, emerges as a promising inspection method alongside SEMbased tools. Further advancements, such as full automation of scanning & tip exchange or highspeed scanning, are currently being developed to overcome the existing limitations of C-AFM 
and enhance its applicability in semiconductor manufacturing [24,25].  
Finally, our thorough comparison of two analytical techniques using similar sample structures 
offers valuable insights for the development of complementary methodologies. Both VC-SEM 
and C-AFM demonstrate their usefulness in examining metal-filled contact hole geometries. 
VC-SEM allows for high-speed scanning, but it requires a high-vacuum environment and 
careful voltage tuning for optimal results. On the other hand, C-AFM provides high-resolution 
imaging at ambient pressure but may require automation and a fast-scanning method for 
improved efficiency. By understanding the advantages and considerations of each technique, 
we can explore their combined potential for comprehensive contact hole analysis. Let us 
discuss the future directions of other inspection methodologies. There is currently no 
appropriate method to assess the condition of contact holes without metallization. The deep 
holes with high aspect ratios are currently best suited for CD-SEM, but this technique does not 
provide conclusive evidence of contact connectivity [12,13]. Cross-sectional TEM is a 
powerful tool, but it is challenging to prepare sliced samples with such deep hole structures, 
and the process is destructive [26]. X-ray-based spectroscopies can be considered to monitor 
the etched holes before the deposition of the metal layer, allowing for the detection of the 
chemical states of the deeply etched holes [27]. Furthermore, the recent advancements in 
optical spectroscopies and machine learning procedures hold great potential for unprecedented 
progress in in-line or in-situ inspection methodologies [28–31].

Conclusion 
We conducted a direct comparison between two inspection methods to monitor the 
electrical connectivity of contact holes, using intentionally designed test specimens that mimic 
realistic samples. The results from VC-SEM demonstrate the ability to distinguish contact 
states based on contrast differences, achieved by selecting the optimal acceleration voltage for 
the specific material and geometry. On the other hand, the C-AFM data exhibit a simpler 
differentiation of current signals between the samples. Both methods are important tools for 
monitoring metal-filled contact holes, and our results provide practical examples to guide the 
development of next-generation semiconductor inspection methodologies. However, there is 
an urgent need for further innovative methodologies to analyze contact holes without metal 
filling, in order to meet the growing demands of high-density and high-speed semiconductor 
devices.
