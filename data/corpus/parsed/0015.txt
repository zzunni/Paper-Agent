ABSTRACT
Intelligence is key to advancing integrated circuit (IC) fabrication.
Recent breakthroughs in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
unlocked extraditionary abilities in understanding images and text,
fostering intelligent fabrication. Leveraging the power of LMMs,
we introduce FabGPT, a customized IC fabrication large multimodal
model for wafer defect knowledge query. FabGPT manifests expertise in conducting defect detection in Scanning Electron Microscope
(SEM) images, performing root cause analysis, and providing expert Q&A on fabrication processes. FabGPT matches enhanced
multimodal features to automatically detect minute defects under
complex wafer backgrounds and reduce the subjectivity of manual
threshold settings. Besides, the proposed modulation module and
interactive corpus training strategy embed wafer defect knowledge into the pre-trained model, effectively balancing Q&A queries
related to defect knowledge and original knowledge and mitigating the modality bias issues. Experiments on in-house fab data
show that FabGPT achieves significant performance improvement
in wafer defect detection and knowledge querying.

INTRODUCTION
The intersection of visual and language models [1–3] has significantly propelled the revolutionary advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), which makes models understand and interpret the world
similarly to humans. Since Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) [4–6]
possess the capability to reason about visual images, they have
attracted considerable attention in defect detection tasks. However,
current LMMs are primarily applied to visual tasks [7–9] in basic
scenarios and lack sensitivity to the knowledge of specialized domains. This limits their efficiency in wafer defect knowledge query
in the field of integrated circuits (IC) fabrication.

Figure 1: Comparisons between our FabGPT and GPT-4 [1],
AnomalyGPT [14], which are fine-tuned on our dataset, for
detecting, locating, and analyzing microscopic defects in complex backgrounds and addressing modality bias issues. Previous arts perform badly while encountering “detection”,
“analysis”, and “modality bias”.
In the semiconductor industry, the manufacturing process is intricate, with each step potentially introducing random defects. These
defects impact the reliability of electronic devices [10–13], making
it essential to detect defects on the wafer surface and perform thorough question-and-answer (Q&A) analysis to deepen engineers’
understanding of these defects and IC questions.
Recent years have witnessed advancements in methods for querying defect knowledge, encompassing both detection and Q&A analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based approaches
[15–19] leverage extensive training data to recognize patterns and
features in images, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency
of defect detection. However, these methods are heavily dependent
on large-scale annotated data and fall short of conducting in-depth
Q&A analysis, which limits their ability to understand complex image content. Moreover, some methods [14, 20] employ large models,
fine-tuning pre-trained models with specific data sets to achieve
superior detection performance, even with limited data availability.
These approaches also demonstrate strong visual understanding
capabilities, enabling them to deduce relevant visual knowledge.

Consequently, integrating wafer defect knowledge from the IC domain into large models is promising to support comprehensive
defect knowledge queries.
However, existing methods based on fine-tuning large models
often face two issues: 1) difficulty in precisely detecting defects
within complex backgrounds; and 2) a loss of the ability to perform
comprehensive Q&A tasks. Despite the vast amount of knowledge
stored in large models, the complex and microscopic structure of
wafer surfaces still prevents them from accurately capturing information such as the number and location of minute defects. As
shown in Figure 1, GPT-4 [1] struggles with queries specific to
wafer defects, and even the fine-tuned AnomalyGPT [14] inaccurately identifies the locations of minute defects. Additionally, as
demonstrated by the dialogue in Figure 1 with AnomalyGPT [14],
the fine-tuned model tends to produce text outputs that are still
biased towards visual content when user queries are not closely
related to the visual input. This is termed as “modality bias”, indicating that the model loses its ability to judge and understand the
textual content of the questions.
To address the issues mentioned above, we propose an efficient
LMM, FabGPT, that employs a three-stage strategy: modal enhancement, detection, and Q&A stage. This strategy allows us to build
on the inherent capabilities of pre-trained models by embedding
high-quality prompt instructions, enabling it to detect wafer defects
in the IC domain and query the related knowledge. Additionally, to
further alleviate “modality bias”, we introduce an interactive corpus
training strategy. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose a knowledge query LMM, FabGPT, based on prompt
learning, which effectively detects minute defects in complex
wafer backgrounds and conducts Q&A analysis on relevant
defect knowledge.
• We design a modal enhancement stage that constrains and
supplements the semantic information in multimodal features,
significantly optimizing the quality of the prompt features.
• A detection head is developed, matching multimodal features
to automatically detect pixel-level defects. This device eliminates the drawbacks of subjective threshold selection while
enhancing defect detection capabilities.
• We propose a Q&A stage and a corpus training strategy that
supervises real-time updating of instruction coefficients and the
interaction of new and old knowledge, addressing the modality
bias in dialogues.
• We conduct comprehensive experiments on our SEM-WaD
dataset, our FabGPT achieves the supervised detection accuracy of 91.81% image-level, 95.61% pixel-level, 88.17% PRO, and
85.80% AP. For Q&A dialogue, it achieves 96.86% accuracy, outperforming the baselines significantly.

PRELIMINARIES
2.1
IC Wafer Defect Analysis
Wafers are the fundamental material for manufacturing IC, and the
quality of their surface directly impacts the reliability of the chips.
By identifying and understanding the various defects on the wafer
surfaces detected by Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) [10, 11,
13], engineers can learn about the attributes such as type, location,
and cause of the defects, which is crucial for optimizing processes

images in the SEM-WaD dataset.
and quality control. Traditional and CNN-based analysis methods
utilize large datasets for feature learning to detect defect regions. For
example, Zontak et al. [21] utilized the periodicity of wafer patterns
to manually construct defect features, thus detecting defects. Gomez
et al. [22] proposed a detection method based on Support Vector
Machines (SVM), which separates data points of different classes
in high-dimensional space using defined hyperplanes. Cheon et al.
[16] proposed a CNN model that can extract effective features for
defect classification. These models achieve significant progress in
classifying and segmenting wafer defects. However, they perform
poorly when faced with scarce data and have not yet developed
a model that integrates classification, segmentation, and analysis.
There is an urgent need for an automated tool capable of detecting
and inferring wafer defects with minimal data.
We use an in-house dataset, SEM-WaD, which comprises 1,226
defect-free images and 1,182 images with four common types of
defects (holes, particles, pattern deformities, and scratches). The
wafer images contain diverse and complex backgrounds, with each
defect type exhibiting unique morphologies and features. Some
examples are shown in Figure 2.
2.2
Large Multimodal Models
LMMs [4–6] are the large and complex models capable of processing various types of data (images, spectra, sound, etc.) and utilize
large-scale datasets during training to understand and generate
descriptions of visual content. Their powerful comprehension and
transfer abilities make them excel in various tasks such as image
description generation and visual question answering. For example,
[4] utilized a linear layer for aligning the frozen video encoder
of the BLIP-2 [23] and the LLM Vicuna [24] to enable image-text
Q&A. [5] adopted a contrastive learning approach to embed the
semantic information of images and text into the same space to
achieve zero-shot transfer. DALL-E [6] generated images related
to text descriptions by encoding text with Transformer and using
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). These models have a
strong ability to understand complex image-text data, however,
they face challenges in robustness when adapting to new domains.
2.3
Fine-Tuning Methods
Fine-tuning methods primarily include full [25, 26] and partial
fine-tuning [14, 20, 27]. In full fine-tuning, all pre-trained model
layer weights are trainable, enabling flexible adaptation to new
data features by adjusting all parameters. For example, BERT [25] is
trained on large corpora adjusting all parameters in its bidirectional

Figure 3: The architecture of FabGPT. The images and the characters extracted from them serve as the primary multimodal input
into a three-stage model, with the label set entering as auxiliary textual input. The first stage enhances semantic information
of multimodal features. Based on the first stage, the detection stage performs pixel-level automated detection, and the Q&A
stage achieves complete Q&A integrating both old and new knowledge.
Transformer structure to optimize tasks such as sentiment analysis question answering and text summarization. Full fine-tuning
improves task adaptation but increases overfitting risk and costs,
limiting its use.
In partial fine-tuning [14, 20, 27], it adjusts only partial parameters in pre-trained models and keeps the rest fixed. Recent popular
partial fine-tuning strategies include Adapters, Prompt Learning,
and LoRA. For example, Lai et al. [20] applied the LoRA method to
consistently update the bottom embeddings and top linear head of
the pre-trained model, while randomly updating a few intermediate
self-attention layers to understand input text for precise segmentation. Gu et al. proposed AnomalyGPT [14], which fine-tunes an
LLM using embedded prompt instructions to identify types and
locations of defects.
Despite their advancements, new models often lose their normal
Q&A capabilities after fine-tuning. This occurs because the model
becomes excessively focused on image inputs while neglecting user
queries, whether or not these queries are related to the images. This
phenomenon is termed “modality bias”. Our model effectively
integrates complex wafer defect knowledge and is designed to
alleviate the modality bias.

PROPOSED METHOD
3.1
Network Architecture
As shown in Figure 3, our FabGPT is a conversational LMM designed for querying wafer defect knowledge, and it consists of
a foundational stage for modal enhancement and two functional
stages for detection and Q&A.
Given a query image 𝑥∈R𝐻×𝑊×3, text marks are extracted
from 𝑥using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology [28].
The image 𝑥, its text marks, and the label set are encoded into
initial vectors 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔, 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑡𝑥𝑡, and 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑙𝑎𝑏
through pre-trained image
and text encoders [29]. 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑙𝑎𝑏are fed into the Prediction
Module (PM) to predict the defect category 𝑃𝑛. Then, 𝑃𝑛is used
to multiply with 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑡𝑥𝑡, generating the vectors 𝑉𝑖𝑚𝑔and
𝑉𝑡𝑥𝑡. Visual and textual adapters further process these vectors into
the information-rich image token 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔and text token 𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡. In the
detection stage, 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡are fed into the detection head to obtain supervised detection masks. In the Q&A stage, the Modulation
Module aligns𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔,𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡, mask-projected token𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠, and the user’s
question token 𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑒into a unified visual token 𝑎𝑇𝑣𝑖𝑠. Finally, it is
concatenated with 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠and 𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑒to serve as prompt instructions
for fine-tuning PandaGPT [2].
3.2
Modal Enhancement Stage
When analyzing the minor defects on the wafer surface, distinguishing between complex background and foreground features is
challenging, which hinders queries on defect-related knowledge. To
address this, we develop the modal enhancement stage, consisting
of the PM and two enhancement branches, designed to highlight
relevant defect features and minimize the impact of irrelevant features.
Prediction Module (PM):
The pre-trained encoder captures pixel-level detail features in the
latent space, but its repeated down-sampling operations result in
the loss of semantic features. As shown in Figure 4 (a), we design the
PM to predict defect categories in the image and enhance semantic
features by embedding the expected result 𝑝𝑛into the initial vectors.
Specifically, we count a label set containing all defect categories
found in wafer images to support automated classification tasks.
First, the linear layer and the activation function are applied to

𝑓𝑖𝑚𝑔= 𝜎(𝑊𝑇
𝑖𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔+ 𝑏𝑖),
𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑏= 𝜎(𝑊𝑇
𝑖𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑙𝑎𝑏+ 𝑏𝑖),
(1)
where𝑊𝑖represents the weight matrix,𝑏𝑖represents the bias vector,
and 𝜎represents the ReLU function. Then, the cosine of the angle
between each category 𝑓𝑖
𝑙𝑎𝑏and 𝑓𝑖𝑚𝑔is computed to assess their
similarity, and the cross-entropy loss function is used to constrain
the selection of the corresponding category 𝑝𝑛. This process is
formulated as:
𝑝𝑖= Cosine(𝑓𝑖𝑚𝑔, 𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑏),
𝑃𝑛= 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑝𝑖)),
= 𝑚𝑎𝑥(
𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑝𝑖)
Í𝑁
𝑗=1 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑝𝑗)
),
(2)
where Cosine represents the cosine similarity calculation. 𝑝𝑛is
matrix-multiplied with 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑙𝑎𝑏, resulting in vectors 𝑉𝑖𝑚𝑔
and 𝑉𝑡𝑥𝑡, which are enriched with semantic features.
Two Enhancement Branches:
Although semantic features related to defect attributes are enhanced, the detailed representation of defect features remains essential. In the visual and textual enhancement branches, adapters
based on prompt learning are deployed, utilizing the extra prompts
of pre-trained experts for adaptive feature optimization. The experts are initialized under the guidance of 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑡𝑥𝑡, which
enable them to acquire knowledge from image and text modals.
During training, they adaptively update parameters and interact
with 𝑉𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑉𝑡𝑥𝑡after each update, effectively controlling the
direction and quality of the feature flow. The final outputs𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔and
𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡are generated, with 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔being represented by the following
formula (the same applies to 𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡):
∇𝑓𝑒= (𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔)𝑖→𝑧𝑖,
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔= 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(∇𝑓𝑒, 𝑉𝑖𝑚𝑔),
(3)
where →represents the feature-guiding operation, 𝑧𝑖and (𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔)𝑖
are the 𝑖-th elements of the random vector 𝑧and 𝑉𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝
𝑖𝑚𝑔respectively,
and ∇𝑓𝑒is the prompt feature of the pre-trained expert.
3.3
Detection Stage
Manually setting segmentation thresholds is not necessarily optimal while continuous adjustments should be made for specific tasks.
We design the detection head that autonomously learns the specific
thresholds for each pixel at feature positions to generate pixel-level
masks Mask ∈R𝐻×𝑊. It first fuses complementary information
from 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔and 𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡through matrix multiplication, then maps them
back to high-dimensional features through four up-sampling operations of the trainable decoder, and normalizes the output into
the mask image through the softmax function. The detection head
matches multimodal information and supervises detail features,
enabling precise defect detection in complex wafer backgrounds.
This process is formulated as:
Mask =𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥((𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔⊗𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡) ↑4
𝑠),
(4)
where (·) ↑4𝑠represents performing four times up-sampling.
3.4
Q&A Stage
In fine-tuning the large models based on prompt instructions, the
commonly used embedded instruction format is:
INS = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑥, 𝑇img, 𝑇que).
(5)
However, this embedding format may lead to modality bias,
where the model is dominated by image inputs and fails to respond
to questions appropriately. For example, the latest defect Q&A
model AnomalyGPT [14] embeds industrial defect knowledge into
its pre-trained model based on Equation (5), it can only answer
questions related to defects, such as:
• “Is there a defect in the image?”
• “Where is the defect located in the image?”
However, it fails to answer general questions not closely related to
the images, such as:
• “What impact does this defect have on the production line?”
• “What are the core process steps in IC manufacturing?”
This phenomenon indicates that while the model gains new information, it loses the understanding of its original knowledge, thereby
diminishing its ability to analyze general knowledge effectively.
We suggest that this phenomenon occurs because the model fails
to judge the correlation between the query image and the user’s
question adequately. The keys to resolving this issue and ensuring
accurate model responses are: 1) Improving the quality of visual instructions; 2) Enhancing the ability to assess the relevance between
visual prompt instructions and user query ones; 3) Optimizing the
training strategies of the corpus.
Modulation Module:
The quality of prompts impacts the model’s understanding and
responses, so aligning multimodal features is needed to capture
comprehensive information and reduce the fine-tuning burden. Inspired by Q-Former [23], a bidirectional self-attention in Figure 4 (b)
allows𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔to absorb semantic and detailed information from𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠
to obtain 𝑓𝑖∼𝑚, facilitating interaction within the same modality,
4

===== Page 5 =====

formulated as:
M𝑖𝑚𝑔= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(((𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔∗𝑘1)(𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔∗𝑘2)𝑇)/
√︁
𝑑𝑘),
M𝑚𝑎𝑘= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(((𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠∗𝑘1)(𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠∗𝑘2)𝑇)/
√︁
𝑑𝑘),
𝑓𝑖∼𝑚= (S𝑖+ S𝑚)
2
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑔,
(6)
where ∗represents convolution operations, 𝑘𝑖represents different
kernels, and 𝑑𝑘represents the dimension of the feature vector. Next,
aligning the fine-grained information between visual features 𝑓𝑖∼𝑚
and textual tokens 𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡through cross-attention [30] allows for the
sharing of complementary knowledge across multimodalities, the
result 𝑓𝑖∼𝑚∼𝑡can be formulated as:
M𝑖∼𝑚∼𝑡= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(((𝑓𝑖∼𝑚∗𝑘1)(𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡∗𝑘2)𝑇)/
√︁
𝑑𝑘),
𝑓𝑖∼𝑚∼𝑡= M𝑖∼𝑚∼𝑡𝑇𝑡𝑥𝑡.
(7)
Finally, to maintain semantic consistency between the LLM and
outputs of the modal enhancement stage, the feed-forward network
maps the unified features 𝑓𝑖∼𝑚∼𝑡to a high-dimensional space and
outputs high-quality prompt instructions 𝑇𝑣𝑖𝑠through the activation of nonlinear layers.
Since the content of user queries involves knowledge of different
tasks, we must assess the relationship between query and visual
instructions before fine-tuning the LLM. We set a scaling factor
𝑎, dynamically adjusting its value through learning the association between instructions (the higher the value, the stronger the
association). A learnable corrector that is generated under the guidance of 𝑇𝑣𝑖𝑠is introduced, and its similarity score with the query is
calculated to simulate the value of 𝑎. It can be formulated as:
𝑎=
∇𝑓𝑐· 𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑒
||∇𝑓𝑐|| · ||𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑒||,
(8)
where · represents the dot product and ∇𝑓𝑐represents the prompt
features of the learnable corrector. We assign 𝑎as the coefficient
to 𝑇𝑣𝑖𝑠. The updated 𝑎𝑇𝑣𝑖𝑠along with 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠and 𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑒serve as our
input instructions, formatted as follows:
g
INS = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑎𝑇𝑣𝑖𝑠, 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑠, 𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑒).
(9)
Corpus Training Strategy:
During the corpus training process, the alternating training strategy balances learning new and old knowledge. We establish two
corpora: Corpus-A, which includes 15 Q&A pairs for each category
related to defect type, quantity, location, description, and analysis
(e.g., Q: What type of defect is in the image? A: The defect in the
image is object.), and Corpus-B, which contains 100 Q&A pairs unrelated to defect knowledge (e.g., Q: What is the capital of China?
A: The capital of China is Beijing.). Our model trains alternately on
these corpora at a 2:1 ratio to prevent it from favoring the retrieval
of new knowledge when understanding questions.
3.5
Loss Functions
We employ three loss functions to constrain detection and dialogue
processes. Focal Loss [31] and Dice Loss [32] are used to improve the
model’s segmentation and localization abilities, and Cross-Entropy
Loss is used to improve the model’s classification and Q&A ones.
Focal Loss:
Focal Loss [31] aims to address the issue of class imbalance.
It introduces a modulation factor 𝛾to reduce the relative loss of
correctly classified pixels and focus on hard-to-classify and misclassified pixels. It is realized as Equation (10):
𝐿focal = −

H × W
H×W
∑︁
𝑖=1
(1 −𝑝𝑖)𝛾log(𝑝𝑖),
(10)
where 𝑝𝑖represents the probability of the pixel belonging to the
correct category, and based on [14], we set the 𝛾to 2.
Dice Loss:
Dice Loss [32] aims to maximize the overlap between outputs
and actual labels, encouraging the model to learn to produce results
closer to the ideal segmentation. It is realized as Equation (11):
𝐿dice = −
ÍH×W
𝑖=1
𝑦𝑖ˆ𝑦𝑖
ÍH×W
𝑖=1
𝑦2
𝑖+ ÍH×W
𝑖=1
ˆ𝑦2

,
(11)
where 𝑦𝑖is the output of the decoder, and ˆ𝑦𝑖is the truth labels.
Cross-Entropy Loss:
Cross-entropy loss measures the difference between predicted
and actual categories in the PM and between output texts of the
language model and target texts in the Q&A task. It is realized as
Equation (12):
𝐿ce = −
𝑐∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑦𝑖log(𝑝𝑖),
(12)
where𝑐represents the number of categories and tokens in classification and Q&A tasks, 𝑦𝑖represents the truth label and 𝑝𝑖represents
the predicted label.
The overall loss function is:
𝐿= 𝛼𝐿𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙+ 𝛽𝐿𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑒+ 𝛿𝐿1
𝑐𝑒+ 𝜖𝐿2
𝑐𝑒.
(13)
We set the coefficients 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛿and 𝜖to 1, by default.

EXPERIMENTS
4.1
Experimental Setups
Datasets:
Our experiment is conducted on the in-house SEM-WaD dataset.
The dataset comprises images with a resolution of 480 × 480, each
accompanied by a corresponding mask image and related textual
descriptions and analyses. We divide the data into training and test
sets in a 7:3 ratio, both containing good and defective images.
Implementation Details:
Our model uses PandaGPT [2] as the foundational LMM, composed of the Vicuna-7B [24] as the language model and ImageBind
Huge [29] as the frozen encoder. During training, we employ the
AdamW optimizer (𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999) [33] with an initial learning
rate of 1𝑒−4, gradually reducing to 1𝑒−6, using the cosine annealing
[34] strategy. The model is trained on three 4090Ti GPUs, with a
batch size of 24 and an epoch of 50.
Evaluations:
In the detection task, we evaluate model performance using
four metrics: Image-AUC (the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), Pixel-AUC, Per-Region Overlap (PRO),
and Average Precision (AP). Image-AUC and Pixel-AUC assess the
model’s ability to judge the presence of defects in images, while
PRO and AP measure the precision of the model in identifying
and locating defects. In the Q&A task, we conduct 15 questions for

each of the four defect types, including inquiries about the presence, category, location, quantity, appearance description, and root
cause analysis of defects. Additionally, we pose 50 questions that
are unrelated to defects and not included in the corpus (IC-related
or IC-unrelated general questions) to validate the modality bias
issue. We use the percentage of correct answers as a relevant metric
to evaluate the Q&A capability of the model. To demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our FabGPT, we compare it with many
representative previous arts:
• DevNet [15]: Learns anomaly representations by labeled anomalies and prior probabilities.
• DRA [17]: A CNN-based learning model for detecting anomalies
in a composite feature space.
• BGAD [19]: An anomaly scoring model that utilizes explicit
boundary generation and boundary-guided optimization.
• PRN [18]: A residual detection model that outputs anomalies
by learning different block features.
• Lisa [20]: An anomaly segmentation LMM utilizing LoRA finetuning method.
• AnomalyGPT [14]: An anomaly detection LMM utilizing prompting learning fine-tuning method.
These baselines are also tuned on our SEM-WaD dataset, following their publicly available implementations and models. Among
these baselines, Lisa [20] and AnomalyGPT [14] are LMMs that
support Q&A while the others do not.

Quantitative Results
Defect Detection Task:
Table 1 report the Image-AUC, Pixel-AUC, PRO, and AP values for different methods across 4 categories within the SEM-WaD
dataset. It can be observed that our model outperforms all other
methods in four evaluation metrics for most defect categories.
For example, compared to AnomalyGPT [14], which also employs
prompt learning for fine-tuning, our model achieves a higher ImageAUC by 1.85% and a higher Pixel-AUC by 3.03%. Compared to the
traditional detection model PRN [18], our model surpasses it by
10.12% in PRO and 14.91% in AP.
Q&A Task:
Table 2 reports the accuracy of different language models in
answering defect-related and -unrelated questions where our model
achieves state-of-the-art results. For example, compared to the
powerful capabilities of GPT-4, our model achieves a comparable
performance in the general questions and a 7.50% higher accuracy
in defect analysis answers. Compared to Lisa [20], which embeds

Qualitative Results
Defect Detection Task:
Comparing heatmaps in Figure 5, we observe that our model
focuses more on defect regions than others, while avoiding concentrating too much on normal regions. Moreover, comparing mask
images in Figure 6, FabGPT provides more accurate edge segmentation details compared to both Lisa [20] and AnomalyGPT [14].
Q&A Task:
According to Figure 7, FabGPT provides detailed defect knowledge, offering engineers valuable insights. Notably, the questions
shown are not part of the training corpus. FabGPT identifies and
localizes defects in SEM images, analyzing properties like "hole." It
identifies root causes and suggests process solutions to optimize the
production line. Additionally, FabGPT accurately answers general
IC questions unrelated to the images, confirming the effectiveness
of our modulation module in addressing modality bias.
4.4
Ablation Studies
In this section, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
importance of each component introduced at every stage and the
operations within them.
Stage Components:
We study the proposed components in each stage as shown in
Table 3. It confirms the importance of each individual component
and the best way to structure the sub-stage. It can be seen that
the prediction of the PM and pre-trained experts significantly improved defect detection in the modal enhancement stage, and the
operations in the modulator played a crucial role in addressing bias
issues in the Q&A stage.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we introduce a novel large multimodal language
model, FabGPT, for defect knowledge querying in the IC field, including defection, analysis, Q&A, etc. It employs three stages to
gradually achieve the functionality of defect detection and highquality dialogue. We validate the effectiveness of FabGPT on the
SEM-WaD dataset and 100 questions. Our work provides great convenience for the semiconductor industry and also offers insights
for further LMM research.
