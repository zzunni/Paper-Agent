Abstract
We prepare NbN thin ﬁlms by DC magnetron sputtering on [100] GaAs substrates, optimise their
quality and demonstrate their use for eﬃcient single photon detection in the near-infrared. The
interrelation between the Nb:N content, growth temperature and crystal quality is established for
4−22nm thick ﬁlms. Optimised ﬁlms exhibit a superconducting critical temperature of 12.6±0.2K
for a ﬁlm thickness of 22 ± 0.5nm and 10.2 ± 0.2K for 4 ± 0.5nm thick ﬁlms that are suitable for
single photon detection. The optimum growth temperature is shown to be ∼475◦C reﬂecting
a trade-oﬀbetween enhanced surface diﬀusion, which improves the crystal quality, and arsenic
evaporation from the GaAs substrate. Analysis of the elemental composition of the ﬁlms provides
strong evidence that the δ-phase of NbN is formed in optimised samples, controlled primarily via
the nitrogen partial pressure during growth. By patterning optimum 4nm and 22nm thick ﬁlms
into a 100nm wide, 369µm long nanowire meander using electron beam lithography and reactive
ion etching, we fabricated single photon detectors on GaAs substrates.
Time-resolved studies
of the photo-response, absolute detection eﬃciency and dark count rates of these detectors as a
function of the bias current reveal maximum single photon detection eﬃciencies as high as 21±2%
at 4.3 ± 0.1K with ∼50k dark counts per second for bias currents of 98%IC at a wavelength
of 950nm. As expected, similar detectors fabricated from 22nm thick ﬁlms exhibit much lower
eﬃciencies (0.004%) with very low dark count rates ≤3cps. The maximum lateral extension of a
photo-generated hotspot is estimated to be 30±8nm, clearly identifying the low detection eﬃciency
and dark count rate of the thick ﬁlm detectors as arising from hotspot cooling via the heat reservoir
provided by the NbN ﬁlm.

Optical quantum information technologies [1] would proﬁt signiﬁciantly from the availability of single photon sources and detectors that can be compactly and directly integrated
on-chip together with passive optical components. In these respects, semiconductor based
2D photonic crystals (PCs) [2] are highly attractive since quantum dots (QDs) serving as
deterministic single photon sources can be embedded into them [3] and passive optical hardware such as waveguides [4–6], beamsplitters [7] and phase-shifters can be integrated around
them [8]. Recently, the eﬃcient directional guiding of single photons from QDs into propagating PC waveguide modes has been theoretically [9] and experimentally [10, 11] investigated,
demonstrating the broad feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, several experiments have
conﬁrmed that the strong light-matter coupling regime is accessible in high-Q PC nanocavities containing individual QDs [12, 13] illustrating that few photon quantum non-linearities
could be exploited to provide the phase and amplitude control [8] needed for photon based
quantum information processing [14]. Whilst much progress has been made, the on-chip detection of single photons on photonic crystal nanostructures [15] would complete the pallete
of components needed for photon based quantum information technologies [16] in a highly
integrated geometry.
Nanowire based superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs) combine high detection
eﬃciency, low dark count rates and picosecond timing resolution [17, 18], properties that
strongly depend on the crystal quality of the NbN ﬁlm and the fabrication process used to
pattern the ﬁlm [19]. The growth of NbN thin ﬁlms on MgO and sapphire substrates is well
established [20], giving rise to critical temperatures as high as TC ∼16.4K [21]. However, the
growth of NbN on crystalline GaAs is challenging due to the 27% lattice mismatch and the
need to deposit ﬁlms at low temperatures [22] below the threshold for thermal decomposition. The ﬁgures of merit that determine SSPD operation are a high superconducting critical
temperature (TC), an abrupt superconducting phase transition (∆TC) and a large critical
current density JC [23]. Building upon recent studies [22] we explored and optimised the
deposition of NbN on GaAs using reactive DC magnetron sputtering and analysed the inﬂuence of growth conditions such as the growth temperature (Tgrowth) and N2:Nb stoichometry
on the crystal phase of thin ﬁlms with thicknesses in the range dNbN = 4 −22nm. By comparing our electrical measurements with detailed materials analysis using Rutherford Back
Scattering (RBS) and X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) we clearly show that the
optimised ﬁlms are both homogeneous and consist primarily of δ-phase NbN [21]. We then
3

continue to present the opto-electrical characterisation of SSPDs fabricated from optimised
ﬁlms. By investigating the time-evolution of photon induced voltage pulses we deduce the
hotspot resistance and the spatial extension of the hotspot along the nanowires. The results
show that the devices fabricated from the 22nm thick ﬁlms exhibit a poor top-illumination
detection eﬃciency (0.004% at 950nm) but a low dark count rate (≤3cps). In contrast, detectors fabricated from much thinner 4nm ﬁlms exhibit detection eﬃciencies up to 21 ± 2%,
albeit with rather high dark count rates (> 50kcps); values that compare very well to the
current state of the art [24, 25] in this material system. The high detection eﬃciencies in
combination with measured low timing jitters of 35ps [26] and the possibility for waveguide
integration [25] makes these devices the ideal candidates for on-chip semiconductor based
quantum photonics.
The NbN thin ﬁlms investigated were grown using DC reactive magnetron sputtering in
an Ar + N2 plasma. Prior to growth, the chamber was conditioned by sputtering NbN at the
desired nitrogen ﬂux to remove contaminants and enhance the growth reproducibility. Before
depositing the ﬁlm, the GaAs [100] substrate was cleaned using acetone and isopropanol
and baked for 4 −6h at 200◦C to remove oxygen whilst remaining below the dissociation
temperature of GaAs which occurs for temperatures of ∼400◦C [27]. During baking, the
chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of Pbase ≤(2.0±1.0)×10−6mbar. After growth, the
NbN ﬁlm was electrically contacted in a 4-point geometry and the temperature dependence
of the ﬁlm resistance was recorded.
Figure 1 compares the temperature dependent resistance measured for a number of NbN
ﬁlms for a range of diﬀerent nitrogen partial pressures PN2 , determined in terms of the N2
percentage of the total Ar + N2 pressure (Ptotal = 0.005 ± 0.001mbar). All ﬁlms presented
in ﬁg 1 exhibit a thickness of dNbN = 22 ± 0.5nm, determined by AFM, and were deposited
at Tgrowth = 350◦C. A clear superconducting phase transition is observed from which TC and
∆TC can be extracted [46]. As PN2 is reduced from 31% to 26%, we observe a clear and
systematic increase of TC from 4.8 ± 0.2K to 9.7 ± 0.2K and a commensurate decrease of
∆TC (0.63 ± 0.03K to 0.46 ± 0.03K). These observations indicate that the crystal quality
improves as the N2 partial pressure decreases.
As PN2 is reduced further from 26% to
24%, TC again reduces to 6.7K and ∆TC increases, signifying a clear optimum nitrogen
partial pressure at this growth temperature. The highest TC and lowest ∆TC observed at
PN2 = 26% can be understood as the PN2 that results in optimum ﬁlm stoichiometry and

microstructure for these growth conditions. A higher PN2 pushes the ratio of N and Nb
adatoms incorporated into the growth surface above the ideal stoichiometry and, thus, leads
to a defective niobium sub-lattice. Similarly, lower PN2 leads to a defective nitrogen sublattice [28]. Since crystalline NbN has a critical temperature of 16.4K [21] and thin (5.5nm)
ﬁlms on GaAs have been reported to exhibit TC up to 10.7K [22], the maximum observed
TC of 9.7K for a 26% nitrogen partial pressure is unlikely to correspond exclusively to the
high-TC δ-phase [29] of NbN. As is conﬁrmed below using materials microscopy, the partial
pressure of PN2 = 26% seems to favour a NbN crystal phase with a correspondingly lower
TC, such as the nitrogen-rich ϵ-phase [29]. In order to change growth conditions in a way
that favours the formation of the desired δ-phase, the growth temperature and PN2 were
systematically varied for a range of 4 −6nm (marked as 5 ± 1nm) and 21 −23nm (marked
as 22 ± 1nm) thick ﬁlms to fully explore the parameter space.
A summary of the results obtained during these PN2 and Tgrowth studies are presented
in ﬁgs 2(a) and 2(b), respectively , where the lower panel shows the measured values of
TC while the upper panel shows ∆TC. To test the reproducibility of the ﬁlm deposition,

we grew and measured three samples with a ﬁlm deposited at Tgrowth = 475◦C, PN2 =
26%. The results obtained were found to be highly reproducible, yielding a small error
bar that was then adopted for all measurements presented in ﬁg 2. The PN2 dependent
measurements were performed for the thick ﬁlms (dNbN = 22nm) at growth temperatures of
350◦C (black squares) and 475◦C (blue triangles), respectively. For the thin, dNbN = 5nm
ﬁlms, the nitrogen partial pressure was varied over the same range for substrate temperatures
of Tgrowth = 475◦C (red circles) only. As already discussed in connection with ﬁg 1, the
maximum TC measured for PN2 = 26% and 350◦C was 9.7K, indicated by the arrow labelled
ϵ in ﬁg 2(a). Furthermore, for both thick and thin ﬁlms grown at 475◦C, a broad maximum
6

===== Page 7 =====

is observed in TC at PN2 = 13 ± 1%, indicated by the arrow labelled δ on ﬁg 2(a).
A
hint of the ϵ maximum is also observed at PN2 ∼26% for the thin ﬁlms (ﬁg 2(a)). The
observation of two maximum TC values for the datasets recorded with PN2 = 26% and
13%, the prominence of which can be varied by changing Tgrowth, suggests that a change
in ﬁlm microstructure occurs from a nitrogen-rich phase at PN2 = 26% to a phase with
lower nitrogen content at PN2 = 13%. Amongst all the diﬀerent crystal phases that occur
for NbN the face-centered cubic δ-NbNx phase with a nitrogen content 0.88 ≤x ≤0.98
has the highest TC of 16.4K [21]. Our observations suggest that the optimum 13% nitrogen
ﬁlm grown at Tgrowth = 475◦C may consist primarily of polycrystalline δ-phase NbN, an
expectation that is supported by the structural microscopy data presented below.
The
phase diagram of NbNx [28] indicates that the hexagonal ϵ-phase is preferentially formed for
nitrogen contents, that are signiﬁcantly higher than the δ-phase [30], lending support to the
indentiﬁcation of the two maxima labelled in ﬁg 2(a). Therefore, we tentatively attribute
the two maxima in TC at PN2 = 26%, indicated by labelled arrows in ﬁg 1, as arising from
δ and ϵ-phases of NbN, respectively.
In order to obtain quantitative insight into the role of the growth temperature in this
picture, we systematically investigated the properties of 5nm and 22nm thick NbN-GaAs
ﬁlms grown at PN2 = 13% and 26% for growth temperatures in the range 350◦C ≤Tgrowth ≤
525◦C. The results of these studies are summarised in ﬁg 2(b). The maximum (minimum)
TC (∆TC) is found to occur close to Tgrowth ∼475◦C for all samples studied, independent of
ﬁlm thickness or the nitrogen partial pressure. This global maximum can be interpreted as
reﬂecting the interplay of two eﬀects; Firstly, for Tgrowth ≥400◦C desorption of As2 from the
GaAs [100] surface begins [31] promoting surface reconstruction and a deviation from ideal
stoichiometry - both eﬀects that may help to overcome the large lattice mismatch between
NbN and GaAs. Secondly, the diﬀusion length of adatoms arriving at the growth surface
signiﬁcantly increases with Tgrowth promoting a transition from the quenched growth regime,
in which poor crystal quality arises from the incorporation of adatoms on the surface close to
point where they arrive, to a more favourable growth regime dominated by surface diﬀusion
[29, 32]. In the quenched growth regime, the microstructure typically consists of columns of
material with poor crystallinity, and even amorphous regions separated by voids while higher
Tgrowth signiﬁcantly promotes improved crystal quality with isotropic equiaxed crystal grains.
Generically, NbN ﬁlms grown at much higher temperatures (≥600◦C) on conventional

substrates such as MgO and sapphire tend to exhibit high TC [20] as a consequence of the
dominance of the surface diﬀusion limited growth regime and resulting high crystal quality.
The observed maximum (minimum) of TC (∆TC) behaviour is found to be independent of the
nitrogen partial pressure during growth, as shown by the similarity of the blue (PN2 = 26%,
dNbN = 22nm) and red (PN2 = 13%, dNbN = 5nm) curves in ﬁg 2(b).
To support these viewpoints and exclude the possibility that the crystal structure and
quality vary strongly with dNbN due to the formation of a buﬀer layer, comparative measurements were performed on several ﬁlms grown under nominally identical conditions, but with
diﬀerent ﬁnal thicknesses (6nm ≤dNbN ≤22nm), and a 19nm thick ﬁlm that was selectively
thinned after growth using reactive ion etching in a SF6/C4F8 plasma. In the following
we refer to these two types of samples as the ”as-grown” and ”thinned” ﬁlms, respectively.

===== Page 9 =====

Figure 3 shows TC (lower panel) and ∆TC (upper panel) as a function of ﬁlm thickness for
as-grown (blue triangles) and thinned (red triangles) ﬁlms. All the NbN ﬁlms studied in ﬁg
3 were grown using PN2 = 26% and Tgrowth = 475◦C. The as-grown ﬁlms had a thickness
dNbN = 22nm, 16nm and 6nm, whereas the thinned ﬁlms were obtained from an initially
19nm thick ﬁlm that was etched back for 0s, 30s, 60s and 90s resulting in ﬁlm thicknesses of
19nm, 17nm, 15nm and 10nm, as measured by AFM. Comparing TC and ∆TC of as-grown
and thinned ﬁlms reveals results that are identical within the experimental error. For asgrown ﬁlms TC decreases from 11.7K to 8.6K as dNbN reduces from ∼22nm to ∼6nm. Over
the same thickness range ∆TC increases from 0.30K to 0.67K. For thinned ﬁlms TC decreases
from 10.1K to 9.2K, whereas ∆TC increases from 0.37K to 0.55K. These trends are in very
good agreement with the ﬁndings of [22], which showed that the reduction of TC (increase of
∆TC) reﬂects the stronger inﬂuence of disorder which induces the superconductor-insulator
transition [33, 34].
The observation of a monotonic dNbN dependence of the superconducting metrics, that
are identical for as-grown and thinned ﬁlms, indicates that the grown ﬁlms are homogeneous
along the growth direction. In addition, the thickness of the NbN ﬁlm appears to have little
or no inﬂuence on the growth conditions indicating that the large lattice mismatch between
NbN and GaAs is most likely accomodated by defects close to the NbN-GaAs interface. In
contrast, crystal quality seems to be intrinsically limited for thinner ﬁlms. The ﬁnding that
the ﬁlm thickness has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the growth conditions of NbN on GaAs is
not at all intuitive, since one would expect a thickness dependence caused by the strain ﬁeld
that builds up due to the 27% lattice mismatch [22] at the NbN-GaAs interface. Considering
these ﬁndings and the data presented in ﬁg 2, we conclude that the nitrogen partial pressure
fully determines the crystal phase, whereas a growth temperature of ∼475◦C provides an
optimum crystal quality independent of ﬁlm thickness.
The clear ﬁlm thickness dependence of the superconducting metrics presented in ﬁg 3
allows us to quantitatively scale the data for the 5nm thick ﬁlms presented in ﬁg 2 and
directly compare it with the data recorded from the 22nm ﬁlm. The result of this procedure
is shown by the grey curve plotted in ﬁg 2(a).
Remarkably, both the form of the data
recorded from the scaled 5nm data and the absolute values of TC (∆TC) agree within the
experimental errors strongly suggesting that the observed maximum in the ﬁlm quality for
PN2 ∼13% is indeed a general result.

ﬁlms as a function of depth obtained by XPS and RBS. (a) corresponds to dNbN = 4nm grown
at PN2 = 13% and (b) shows dNbN = 22nm grown at PN2 = 26%. Both ﬁlms were grown for
Tgrowth = 475◦C. PN2 = 13% grown ﬁlms consist of nitrogen poor fcc δ-NbN, as indicated by the
blue shaded region, whereas PN2 = 26% grown ﬁlms exhibit nitrogen rich hexagonal ϵ-NbN, as
indicated by the red shaded region. The corresponding crystal structures are adapted from [28].
We continue by presenting direct measurements of the depth proﬁle of the atomic composition and stoichiometry of the NbN ﬁlms grown using the optimum growth temperature
of Tgrowth = 475◦C and obtain results that strongly support these conclusions. Depth dependent X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and Rutherford backscattering (RBS)
measurements were performed through the NbN ﬁlm, and into the GaAs substrate, to conﬁrm that the nitrogen concentration during growth does indeed determine the crystal phases
and that the optimised ﬁlms consist primarily of δ−phase NbN. Measurements were performed on two ﬁlms grown with 13% (4nm thick) and 26% (22nm thick) nitrogen partial

pressures as marked by arrows on ﬁg 2(a). Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the depth dependent atomic concentrations (bottom panels) and nitrogen content x (top panels) for the
13% (4nm thick) and 26% (22nm thick) ﬁlms, respectively. The XPS measurements reveal
a thin NbOx layer at the surface with a thickness of ∼1nm. This ﬁnding compares very
well with the observations from the etching depth dependent measurements presented in ﬁg
3 that showed no diﬀerence between the unetched sample and the sample etched for 30s,
as indicated by the dashed circle. While the oxygen concentration decreases rapidly with
depth, to levels below 4% for the thick ﬁlm, the oxygen concentration remains above ∼4%
for the thin ﬁlm throughout the NbN layer. This can be clearly seen by the red curve in
ﬁg 4. Since both samples were grown for the same base pressure of Pbase < 3 · 10−6mbar,
the oxygen concentration should be equal for both ﬁlms and, hence, we interpret the higher
oxygen concentration in the thin ﬁlm to post-growth oxygen interdiﬀusion. Whilst the oxygen concentration decreases, the Nb and N content in both samples increases and then
remains constant throughout the entire ﬁlm. At the NbN-GaAs interface we again observe
a thin oxygen rich layer with a thickness of ∼1nm and the stoichiometry of the GaAs layer
deviates from the expected value of 50%. This observation correlates very well with the
thermal dissociation of GaAs at the surface for Tgrowth ≥400◦C due to As2 desorption. The
resulting arsenic vacancies appear to be occupied by Nb atoms, as shown in the atomic
concentrations in the bottom panels of ﬁg 4. The top panels of ﬁg 4 show the nitrogen
concentration x of the NbNx ﬁlms as a function of depth for the ﬁlm grown at 13% N2 (left
panel) and 26% N2 (right panel). The range of x that would correspond to δ-NbN [28, 30] is
indicated schematically by the blue hatched region, whereas the range corresponding to the
ϵ-phase [28, 30] is denoted by the red shaded region, respectively. For the thin ﬁlm, grown
at 13% N2, x increases from 0 to ∼0.89 within the 1nm thick region of the ﬁlm closest
to the surface. Thereafter, x slowly decreases again for depths ranging from 2 to 3nm but
remains entirely within the range expected for δ-NbN. Afterwards, a sharp decrease in x
is observed close to the NbN-GaAs interface. From these measurements we conclude that
the ﬁlm grown for PN2 = 13% does indeed consist of the δ-phase having high TC, in good
agreement with observations from the electrical transport measurements and the optimised
superconductivity metrics presented in ﬁgures 1 and 1. The data for the sample grown at
PN2 = 26%, presented in the rightmost column of ﬁg 4, exhibits a similarly sharp increase in
x over the uppermost 1nm. However, in contrast to the thin sample a much higher value of

Schematic of opto-electrical SSPD characterisation setup.
A meander-type detector
(SEM pictures on the left) is operated just below the critical current IC by using a bias-tee (1.5mH
inductance and 0.22µF capacitance) connected to a 100kΩresistor and a constant voltage source
Vb. The SSPD can be modelled as an inductor Lk and a time-dependent resisitor Rn(t). As depicted
schematically in the leftmost SEM image, a normal conducting region Rn is formed upon photon
absorption. This leads to a redirection of the bias current onto the output-capacitor, producing a
voltage pulse V (t) which is monitored using an oscilloscope.
x ∼1.2 is reached. Afterwards, x gradually decreases to ∼1.05 within the next ∼2nm and
then remains constant in the range expected for the ϵ-phase, until the NbN-GaAs interface
is reached. These observations support the conclusion that ﬁlms grown with PN2 = 26%
consist primarily of the nitrogen-rich ϵ-phase, supporting the conclusions reached in relation
to the discussion of ﬁg 2.
Using optimised, predominant δ-phase NbN ﬁlms we fabricated SSPDs in the typical
meander-type geometry [17] on 4nm and 22nm thick ﬁlms.
In the following, these two
samples are termed the thin and thick SSPDs, respectively.
The SSPD fabrication was
performed using a negative tone electron beam resist for patterning of the detectors. After
development of the exposed resist, the sample is reactively etched in a SF6/C4F8 plasma,
transferring the electron beam written structures onto the NbN ﬁlm. This results in 10 ×
10µm2 NbN meanders on GaAs, each of which consists of 41 NbN nanowires with a width
of 100±5nm, as presented in the SEM images in ﬁg 5. In order to electrically address single
detectors in a low-temperature microwave probe station, Ti/Au contact pads were deﬁned
using photo-lithography. For opto-electrical characterisation, the sample was cooled down
to T = 4.3 ± 0.1K and single detectors are electrically connected to the bias-tee that has
12

===== Page 13 =====

an inductance of 1.5mH and a capacitance of 0.22µF (ﬁg 5). A ﬁxed bias-voltage Vb in
series with a 100kΩresistor is fed into the DC port of the bias-tee, operating the detector
at a drive-current Ib = Vb/100kΩ. The AC port of the bias-tee is directly connected to a
20GHz sampling oscilloscope with a 50Ωinput impedance for pulse-shape measurements, as
depicted schematically in ﬁg 5. Such meander type nanowire detectors can be electrically
modelled as an inductor Lk in series with a time-dependent resistor Rn(t) [35, 36]. When
operating the device with a bias current ISSPD = Ib, slightly below the device-critical current
IC, the absorption of a photon by a Cooper pair creates a small normal conducting region,
a so-called hotspot, which then extends across the whole wire [37, 38].
This process is
schematically depicted in the SEM picture in the upper left panel of ﬁg 5. The appearance
of Rn ̸= 0 in the left arm of the circuit redirects a part of the bias current Iout = Ib −ISSPD
into the right arm leading to a voltage pulse V (t) at the oscilloscope. Due to the ohmic
character of Rn, higher bias currents result in higher voltage pulses, as shown in the V (t)
data presented in ﬁg 5. After hotspot healing, the recovery of the current is limited to a
nanosecond timescale by the rise time τI,rise = Lk/50Ω[35], thereby limiting the detector
countrate to a few hundred MHz.
To probe the time evolution of the hotspot resistance, both thick and thin SSPDs were
operated and measured using the circuit presented in ﬁg 5. Laser pulses with a duration of
∼90ps at λ = 950nm were delivered by a laser diode with a repetition rate of 80MHz. Light
is focussed onto the detector using a long working distance compound objective. Typical
voltage pulses V (t) arising from the response of the thick and thin detectors are shown in
the inset of ﬁg 5. For the thick detector the observed pulses could be detected directly by a
20GHz sampling oscilloscope, whereas voltage traces originating from the thin SSPD were
ampliﬁed using two calibrated low-noise 30dB high-frequency ampliﬁers. For the further
analysis, the ampliﬁcation and pulse shortening due to high-pass ﬁltering of the ampliﬁers
were corrected to reproduce the original, photo-generated pulse shape. The kinetic inductance of the corresponding device was determined by ﬁtting an exponential decay to the
falling edge of the voltage trace. The thick SSPD then exhibits Lk = 76 ± 14nH, whereas
the thin SSPD shows Lk = 393 ± 20nH, the diﬀerence between the two values being in
very good agreement with Lk = Lk
R
ds/A(s), where Lk is the kinetic inductivity, A is the
cross-sectional area and integration is done along the wire [35, 39]. The temporal evolution
of the hostpot resistivity Rn(t) and the corresponding current drop ISSPD(t) can then be

obtained from V (t) by using a simple electro-dynamic model [47] for the circuit shown in
ﬁg 5. The data was recorded for a ﬁxed bias current of Ib = 0.56IC for the thin SSPD and
0.75IC for the thick one, as indicated by the dashed blue lines in ﬁg 6a. The current through
the detector ISSPD(t) (blue circles) and the hotspot resistance Rn(t) (red squares) are presented in a logarithmic scale in ﬁg 6a for the thin detector (top panel) and the thick detector
(bottom panel), respectively. For the thick detector the resistance builds up within 1.3ns
to a maximum value of Rmax = 72Ωand then reduces to zero within ∼0.8ns. In contrast,
the thin SSPD shows a 35× larger maximum resistance of 2.5kΩwhich is ∼50% smaller
than typical values for SSPDs on MgO substrates [36]. Furthermore, when compared to the
thick device the resistance build-up and healing takes place over much faster timescales for
the thin devices (0.7ns and 0.4ns, respectively). For both cases, a drop of ISSPD is observed
14

===== Page 15 =====

shortly after the hotspot resistivity starts to build up, delayed by the kinetic inductance
of the device. For the thick detector, the current drops to 74% (34 −25µA), whereas the
current through the thin detector reduces to 6% (3.4 −0.2µF), reﬂecting the much higher
resistance of the thin device. Again, delayed by the kinetic inductance, the current then
recovers with a rise time of 1.5±0.3ns for the thick detector and 7.9±0.4ns for the thin one,
the diﬀerence arising from the ﬁlm thicknesses. However, the 34× larger hotspot resistivity
of the thinner detector cannot be explained by a 5.5× smaller ﬁlm thickness alone. As the
build-up of a resistive region across the entire wire upon photon absorption is determined by
a complex interplay of various eﬀects [17, 36, 40], we present here a qualitative explanation
for the observed behaviour. To get a better understanding of the responsible mechanisms,
the horizontal extension of the hotspot along a nanowire is estimated for both cases. With
the knowledge of the ohmic resistance Rwire of a single nanowire of length lwire for temperatures T > TC, the horizontal extension of the photon induced resistive region lmax along the
nanowire can be estimated to be lmax = lwire × Rmax/Rwire. Here, Rwire is determined from
the current voltage characteristics of the investigated devices where a sequential switching
of the nanowires from superconducting state to normal conductivity is observed. Now lmax
can be estimated to be 270±10nm for the thin detector and 30±8nm for the thick detector,
as schematically shown in ﬁg 6b. Here, the larger hotspot extension of the thinner detector
promotes a faster cooling of the resistive region via phonon emission into the adjacent GaAs
substrate. In addition, thermal boundary conductivity at the NbN/GaAs interface scales
with 1/dNbN [36] and, hence, is expected to be signiﬁcant higher for the thin device. In case
of the thick detector the initially photon-created hotspot with an extension of ∼13nm [41]
cannot extend as fast and wide as for the thin device due to heat transfer within the wire
[36]. Here, cooling inside the comparatively larger heat sink provided by the surrounding
nanowire takes place, before switching of the side channels [17, 40] and creation of the entire
resistive region occours. Therefore, if the photon absorption leads to a detectable event, the
resistance and its lateral extension are expected to be smaller, since hotspot quenching is
promoted during the longer resistance built up, as observed in ﬁg 6a. These considerations
suggest a considerably lower dark count rate for thick SSPD devices, however, at the price
of a much smaller detection eﬃciency.
In order to determine the detection eﬃciency, we set an event-treshhold level Vt that
both rejects the noise of the readout-electronics but does not cut oﬀany photon detection
15

===== Page 16 =====

events. In order to ﬁnd the optimum value of Vt, the device was illuminated with a constant
calibrated photon ﬂux and a histogram of the ampliﬁed voltage pulses of the detection events
was recorded for diﬀerent values of I/IC. The results of typical measurements are presented
in ﬁgure 6c for the thin (leftmost panel) and thick (rightmost panel) detectors. For these
measurements the maximum output voltage was recorded within each trigger cycle, as given
by the laser repetition rate. The data presented shows the average over 500 independent
measurements. In this way, the number of events depicted in the histogram reﬂects the
number of registered photon detection events per time and, therefore, when compared with
the calibrated incident photon ﬂux on the detector, the corresponding detection eﬃciency.
As one would expect from other reports in the literature [42, 43], the detectivity scales
exponentially with the drive current, an eﬀect that can be clearly seen in the data recorded
for the thick detector. In contrast, the thin detector was operated in saturation, so the
histograms show no increase of the registered events for higher drive currents. Besides, a clear
shift of the mean pulse height is observed for increasing bias currents reﬂecting the ohmic
nature of the photon induced resistive region. For the following count-rate measurements,
presented in ﬁgure 7, the voltage treshhold level was set to be 80mV for the thin SSPD and
to 700mV for the thick detector, respectively.
Before discussing further experimental ﬁndings of thick and thin detectors, we compare
these devices with respect to their critical current densities JC = IC/A (with the wire crosssection A) and ﬁnd the ratio Jthick
C
/Jthin
C
= 1.3 ± 0.2. However, since JC is expected to be
solely a property of the crystal phase, this ratio should be close to unity. By deﬁning an
eﬀective active ﬁlm thickness deﬀ= dNbN −dOx, where deﬀis the active thickness of the
superconducting NbN layer and dOx is an optically and electrically dead oxide layer, we
found that this ratio becomes unity for dOx ∼1nm, in excellent agreement with the XPS
results presented in ﬁg 4. Therefore, SSPDs fabricated from the 4nm ﬁlm have an eﬀective
thickness deﬀ= 3 ± 0.5nm and, due to their extremely small thickness, are expected to
show very high detection eﬃciencies [44]. For the detectivity and dark count measurements,
presented in ﬁgure 7, the oscilloscope in the circuit in ﬁg 5 is replaced by two low-noise
30dB high-bandwidth ampliﬁers which are connected to a 350MHz frequency counter. The
respective SSPD is now operated at a ﬁxed bias current ratio I/IC, as indicated for each
data series presented in ﬁg 7. The device is illuminated using a parallel laser beam with a
carefully calibrated circular intensity proﬁle with a diameter of dbeam = 5.5 ± 0.1mm (see

FIG. 7:
Number of detected photon events as a function of the top-incident photon number
for a 4nm thin SSPD (a) and a 22nm thick SSPD (b), respectively. Data is shown in a double
logarithmic plot and presented for diﬀerent I/IC ratios. The corresponding dark count rates are
indicated by the dashed lines on the left. The solid lines are linear ﬁts with slopes of 0.98 ± 0.02
(thin device) and 1.09 ± 0.03 (thick device) revealing the single photon character of the detected
events. A maximum detection eﬃciency of 21 ± 2% is reached for the 4nm detector at 0.98IC,
whereas the 22nm SSPD shows 0.004±0.001% detectivity for a current of 0.99IC. The inset shows
the measured beam proﬁle used for illumination.
ﬁg 7b - inset). The recorded number of events per second (open symbols in ﬁg 7) is then
corrected for the respective dark count rate (dashed line in ﬁg 7). In order to calibrate the
incident photon arrival rate on the detector, the beam proﬁle was mapped by scanning the
beam accross a 500±100µm diameter pinhole and measuring the transmitted power proﬁle,
as shown in the inset of ﬁg 7b. A horizontal cross-section of the beam proﬁle at Y = 5mm
is shown in red. Now the number of incident photons on the detector can be calculated
using Nγ = P/(ℏω) × ASSPD/(πd2
beam/4) × xloss × xbeam with the average power of the beam
P, the photon energy ℏω, the active area of the detector ASSPD, the measured losses at
cryostat windows xloss and the correction factor arising from the detector position within
the beam proﬁle xbeam. For both the 4nm thin (ﬁg 7a) and the 22nm thick (ﬁg 7b) detector
we observe a clear linear increase of photon detection events as a function of the incident
photon number in this double logarithmic plot for all shown bias current ratios, proving that
the detectors operate in the single photon regime [41, 42]. The solid lines are ﬁts with an
17

===== Page 18 =====

exponent of 0.98 ± 0.02 for the thin SSPD and 1.09 ± 0.03 for the thick one, respectively.
The fact that the observed behaviour is slightly superlinear for the thick device suggests
that a small percentage of detected events arises from double photon events, in agreement
with expectations for larger detector areas [41]. For both the thin and thick SSPDs the
dark count rate as well as photon counts at a ﬁxed photon ﬂux scale exponentially with
I/IC, which is in good agreement with previous publications [42, 43]. In order to estimate
the maximum device detection eﬃciency, the number of detected events is divided by the
number of incident photons at 0.98I/IC for the thin, 4nm detector and for 0.99I/IC for the
thick, 22nm one, respectively. This was done for the maximum possible photon ﬂux that did
not push the detector permanently into a normal conducting state caused by a reduction
of the critical current due to device heating [36]. In this way the detection eﬃciency η for
top-illumination using light at 950nm was determined to be η = 21±2% for the thin detector
at an ungated dark count rate of 52000 per second. This compares very well to the current
state-of-the-art NbN SSPD detectors on GaAs that have been reported to have a normal
incidence detection eﬃciency of 18.3% at 1300nm [24], as well as to ﬁndings reported for
other substrates [17, 40, 45]. Also the high dark count rate compares well with other values
reported in literature [25]. In contrast, the thick SSPD exhibits a much lower detection
eﬃciency η = 0.004±0.001% with an almost negligible dark count rate of only 3 per second.
This observation is fully expected from the hotspot analysis presented in ﬁgure 6 and is in
very good accord with the ﬁndings reported in [44].
In summary, we optimised the growth of NbN thin ﬁlms on GaAs substrates by varying the
substrate temperature and N2 partial pressure. Optimum crystal phases for SSPD operation
were obtained using a nitrogen partial pressure of PN2 = 13% at a growth temperature of
Tgrowth = 475◦C. Evidence was obtained that these conditions promote the formation of the
high TC δ-phase of NbN. Under these growth conditions an optimised dNbN = 4±0.5nm thin
ﬁlm with TC = 10.2±0.2K and ∆TC = 0.53±0.03K has been obtained, values which are very
close to the state of the art on GaAs substrates [22]. For lower Tgrowth the superconducting
critical temperature reduces signiﬁcantly. The maximum TC = 9.7K for 22nm ﬁlms for PN2 =
26% and Tgrowth = 350◦C was attributed to the formation of the hexagonal ϵ-phase with
signiﬁcantly lower TC values, as compared to δ-NbN. By systematically varying Tgrowth, we
observe an optimum value of 475◦C, independent of nitrogen partial pressure, attributed to a
trade-oﬀbetween disorder induced by arsenic evaporation and higher crystal quality caused
18

===== Page 19 =====

by increased surface diﬀusion. Finally, the growth conditions responsible for the formation
of δ- and ϵ-NbN, have been veriﬁed using RBS and depth dependent XPS measurements.
Superconducting single photon detectors were fabricated and characterised for 4 and 22nm
thick optimised NbN ﬁlms. The electro-optical characterisation of the devices revealed an
extension of the photon induced resistive region of 270 ± 10nm for the thin SSPD and
30 ± 8nm for the thick detector. By varying the normally incident photon number and
measuring the detected photon events, the single photon character of both devices was
proven. The maximum detection eﬃciency was determined to be 0.004±0.001% for the thick
detector and 21 ± 2% for the thin detector, following excitation with 950nm photons. The
origin of the negligibly low dark count rate for the thicker detector, operated at 4.3 ± 0.1K,
was attributed to hotspot quenching with the 22nm thick ﬁlm acting as a heat sink. The
evanescent coupling of such SSPDs with waveguides is likely to signiﬁcantly improve these
performance metrics, providing strong potential for the development of integrated single
photon quantum optics using semiconductors.
