Abstract. The capability to finely tailor material thickness with simultaneous 
atomic precision and non-invasivity would be useful for constructing quantum 
platforms and post-Moore microelectronics. However, it remains challenging to 
attain synchronized controls over tailoring selectivity and precision. Here we 
report a protocol that allows for non-invasive and atomically digital etching of van 
der Waals transition-metal dichalcogenides through selective alloying via lowtemperature thermal diffusion and subsequent wet etching. The mechanism of 
selective alloying between sacrifice metal atoms and defective or pristine 
dichalcogenides is analyzed with high-resolution scanning transmission electron 
microscopy. Also, the non-invasive nature and atomic level precision of our 
etching technique are corroborated by consistent spectral, crystallographic and 
electrical characterization measurements. The low-temperature charge mobility 
of as-etched MoS2 reaches up to 1200 cm2V-1s-1, comparable to that of exfoliated 
pristine counterparts. The entire protocol represents a highly precise and noninvasive tailoring route for material manipulation.  
 
Modern science and technology have benefited vastly from the ever-increasing 
capability of fine control on material dimensions. For instance, in two-dimensional (2D) 
van der Waals materials, the reduced dimensionality by approaching the atomic 
thickness can result in major changes in fundamental physical characteristics such as 
the density of states, band structures1,2, crystal electrostatic fields3,4 and even lattice 
symmetries, which allows for emerged couplings of material parameters, such as 
electron wavefunction radii and magnetic interaction lengths. This provides a platform 
for exploring intriguing physical phenomena such as Dirac fermions2, valley chirality5, 
Moiré superlattices3,4, and thickness sensitive magnetism6,7. On the other hand, the

continuous downscaling in modern microelectronics has brought the industry to 
technology nodes of several nanometers8. In the near future, a finer control up to atomic 
levels will be soon required9. In this context, atomically thin 2D semiconductors, in 
particular monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) which exhibit ideal 
surface flatness and sizeable carrier mobility, are regarded as promising channel 
materials in the post-silicon era9-11. For achieving large-area atomic channels, the most 
straightforward but yet challenging route is to bottom-up grow homogeneous 
monolayer wafers directly, while it also represents a possible route to tailor the 
pristinely inhomogeneous few-layer wafers into homogeneous ones through selective 
top-down etching. 
For both the fundamental and applied purposes, it is highly anticipated that the 
original crystallinity, thus the intrinsic physical properties of the materials, are 
preserved after material processing. In this regard, a protocol enabling simultaneously 
non-invasive and digital etching of TMDCs, that is precise layer-by-layer removal of 
the topmost monolayer while keeping the underlying intact, represents a keen 
anticipation and, on the same time, a big challenge. Previous approaches developed for 
atomic etching of van der Waals TMDCs, including plasma bombardment12–14, laser 
treatment15,16, and thermal oxidation17, are all proven invasive to materials because they 
generally exert less selective etching effects on the layers to be removed and preserved, 
thus resulting in degraded electronic performance. To date, the techniques that allow 
for non-invasive etching of the 2D van der Waals crystals are still highly sought after. 
Here we report a soft protocol for non-invasive digital etching of van der Waals 
TMDCs by exploiting the selective thermal diffusion of a sacrificial metal into assigned 
TMDC layers and subsequent removal of the surfacial alloy layer. Synergic strategies 
including surface defect engineering and low-temperature annealing were devised to 
strictly limit the etching depth to a monolayer at each etching cycle. The nature of layerby-layer digital etching was confirmed by aberration-corrected high-resolution 
scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM), atomic force microscope 
(AFM), secondary harmonic generation (SHG) and Raman spectroscopy. Both the 
crystallographic and electrical characterizations suggest that the high lattice quality and 
intrinsic transport performance are preserved in the as-etched samples, implying the 
non-invasivity of the protocol. Besides the non-invasivity and atomic-level precision, 
the strategy also features important advantages including multiple processability, 
universality for different TMDC materials and CMOS compatibility. The underlying 
physics for the selective thermal diffusion between nearly perfect pristine and defective 
van der Waals lattices is also extensively studied. The research results well address a 
grand etching challenge confronted in material science and open a door to thoroughly 
exploit the van der Waals TMDC crystals for quantum and electronic purposes.  
 
Results and Discussion 
Rationale for defect engineering. Our protocol for the non-invasive digital layerby-layer etching mainly comprises the following steps. First, metal Al sacrificial layers 
are deposited selectively onto local defect-engineered TMDC areas to be thinned. Then, 
controlled thermal diffusion of Al into TMDCs is achieved by tuning the temperature 
and duration in the subsequent step of thermal annealing. Finally, the layers of Al and 
its alloy with TMDCs are wet etched with acid or basic solutions. We emphasize that, 
without appropriate defect engineering in the first step, a simple implementation of such 
protocol could cause uncontrollable Al diffusion and thus random etching into 
underlying layers in our preliminary attempts, as depicted in Fig. 1a. In circumstance 
that no artificial defects are produced, we found that the thermal diffusion of Al into

TMDCs still relies on the pristine, randomly distributed vacancies in lattices18, which 
result in disordered diffusion inside the van der Waals materials, because they can 
reduce local diffusion energy barriers and serve as the starting sites to guide the 
disordered diffusion, as shown in Fig. 1c.  
Uncontrollable thermal diffusion of Al into pristine MoS2. In the preliminary 
experiments where no artificial defect engineering was performed, we first investigated 
the thermal diffusion mechanism of Al into freshly mechanically exfoliated MoS2, 
which is proven to be the defect-assisted diffusion proess as mentioned above, by 
simply exploring the dependence of diffusion rate on annealing temperature (Ta). Figure 
1b–d shows the optical images of three MoS2 samples washed with acid, after one-hour 
thermal diffusion of Al at Ta = 250, 300 and 350 °C, respectively. With increasing Ta 
the corrosion pits become deeper and spatially more extended, as indicated by the 
dashed rectangles. Indubitably, Ta is an important parameter to promote the Al atoms 
to overcome the diffusion barriers within MoS2 and, normally following the Arrhenius 
relationship, to determine the diffusion rate and overall etching depth18. Noteworthy, at 
low Ta (up to 250 °C) no appreciable traces of Al diffusion and corrosion pits are 
observed, suggesting a negligible diffusion of Al into the pristine (nearly perfect) MoS2 
lattices. For samples annealed at intermediate Ta (300 °C), a mixture of corrosion pits 
and unetched islands are monitored in Fig. 1c, indicating that the thermal diffusion of 
Al into pristine MoS2 lattice is a poorly uniform process, mainly guided by the 
disordered lattice vacancies present in pristine samples. Although the pristine MoS2 can 
be thinned at this temperature, the thickness reduction features a modest control.  
Cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF) and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) by HR-STEM made it possible to monitor the 
boundaries between layers to further unveil the interlayer diffusion behavior at different 
Tas. Figure 1e–i shows the typical HR-STEM images and corresponding EDS elemental 
mappings for the Al/MoS2/SiO2 stacks annealed at 250 °C. They exhibit two sharp 
interfaces for the encapsulated MoS2 layers, validating the negligible diffusion of the 
upper Al or the underlying SiO2 into the encapsulated MoS2 layers at such a low Ta. 
Conversely, the images for the stack annealed at 300 °C are displayed in Fig. 1j–m.  
The HAADF image displayed in Fig. 1j is informative. First, it shows that the 
interlayer diffusion of Al and MoS2 indeed occurs at this elevated temperature, resulting 
in the delamination of local MoS2 up to 6 layers in the central area. The Al/MoS2 alloy 
area indicated by dotted lines resembles a surface bubble. Second, the thermal diffusion 
of metal atoms into the van der Waals materials appears as a rather ordered process 
along the vertical direction that tends to terminate at the van der Waals gaps and gives 
rise to a clear diffusion boundary in the central area. Thus, it is expected that the breadth 
of the diffusion depth can be further finely controlled within a monolayer at a low Ta 
below 300 °C. Third, a mixed combination of alloy and unreacted areas (sharp 
boundaries), with roughly equal probabilities, are observed in the extended HR-STEM 
images (Supplementary Fig. 2a), suggesting the diffusion mechanism in pristine MoS2 
as follows. Given the low energy of formation of sulfur vacancies and the trend of sulfur 
loss at elevated temperatures19-21, it is thus deduced that the random Al diffusion is 
associated with the disordered sulfur vacancies pristinely present and/or thermally 
created. They reduce the diffusion barriers of local areas and act as permeation paths 
for external atoms, resulting in the disordered Al diffusion through the underlying MoS2 
layers18,22.  
Principle of controllable diffusion via defect engineering. To circumvent the 
issue of random and excessive Al diffusion, we devised a “selective diffusion” strategy 
aimed at producing uniform diffusion sites and, at the same time, spatially confining

diffusion depth within the thickness of one monolayer. The basic idea is to predefine 
surfacial lattice vacancies distributed uniformly in the topmost layer before thermal 
diffusion, which is expected to reduce only the diffusion barrier of the topmost layer 
and produce a vast difference in the diffusion rates, which increases exponentially by 
lowing diffusion barrier, of Al atoms between the defective topmost and pristine 
underlying TMDC layers. Theoretical studies revealed that Ar plasma irradiation can 
produce various single- and multiple-atom vacancies (e.g., S, Mo and MoS6) into MoS2 
lattices23. Hence, by applying a controlled short duration of Ar plasma irradiation and 
introducing a limited low density of vacancies in the surfaces, the topmost layer can be 
tailored to exhibit much larger diffusion rates than the underlying layers. Accordingly, 
the topmost and underlying layers would exhibit selective overall etching rates, which 
is beneficial for selectively etching the topmost layer while minimizing the negative 
corrosive impact on the underling layers. In addition, we try to minimize Ta as low as 
250 °C, which can ensure regular diffusion rates for Al into defective topmost layer but 
negligible rates into pristine underlying layers, as proven in Fig. 1b.  
Theoretical calculations also indicate that the diffusion barrier for Al via sulfur 
vacancies into a defective MoS2 lattice is about 90 meV, being 8 times lower than in a 
pristine crystal (Supplementary Note 5). According to the Fick’s law of diffusion18, the 
8-fold variation in diffusion barrier corresponds to a huge difference of 106 in thermal 
diffusion coefficients between the defective and pristine lattices at 250 °C, constituting 
the rationale behind the selective etching.  
Layer-by-layer digital etching. With the “selective diffusion” strategy in mind, 
we then perform the devised non-invasive digital etching protocol on defective 
engineered MoS2 samples. Figure 2a–d illustrates the processing flow and 
corresponding optical images at each step for the soft etching technique. Initially, a 
low-energy Ar plasma irradiation is applied onto exfoliated MoS2 layers to introduce 
vacancies into the topmost MoS2 layers (Fig. 2a). The irradiation energy and duration 
are carefully controlled to ensure that only the topmost sulfur atoms are affected without 
damaging the underlying layers (Supplementary Notes 8 and 9). Then, a 10 nm metal 
Al strip is deposited onto MoS2 (Fig. 2b), followed by a diffusion process at 250 °C for 
0.5 h (Fig. 2c). At such low Ta, the Al atoms diffuse mainly through the defective 
topmost layer, leaving the underlying layers almost intact. Lastly, the Al strip and its 
alloy with the topmost MoS2 layer are dissolved in hydrochloric acid and, consequently, 
a monolayer of MoS2 is removed (Fig. 2d). 
A critical requirement for the digital etching technique is to precisely control the 
etching depth down to one monolayer. To check the etching depth and surface flatness 
of the as-etched area, we performed AFM measurements on the as-etched samples in 
order to determine the thickness change and surface topography. As shown in Fig. 2e, 
after one-cycle (1C) processing, the step height between the pristine (0C) and etched 
areas is about 0.67 nm, which is consistent with the theoretical value of the thickness 
of a MoS2 monolayer, being 0.615 nm24, and verifies the nature of layer-by-layer 
etching of this technique. Besides, the root mean square roughness of the etched area is 
estimated to be 0.38 nm, which is comparable to that of the pristine area ~0.43 nm, 
proving the excellent surface quality of the as-etched area. Cross-sectional and topview images recorded by HR-STEM also confirmed the nature of layer-by-layer 
tailoring of this technique. In Fig. 2f a sharp monolayer step produced by etching can 
be clearly seen in the cross-sectional image taken at the trilayer/tetralayer (3L/4L) step 
while in Fig. 2g a clear contrast between the monolayer (1L) and bilayer (2L) areas can 
be observed in the top-view image taken for an etched 2L sample. Moreover, the HRSTEM images can be used to accurately evaluate the lateral resolution of our etching

technique, owing to unwanted lateral diffusion. After analysis on the edge profiles of 
the alloy areas, we conclude that the lateral resolution at above etching condition is 
better than 1.5 ± 0.3 nm. Detailed discussion can be found in Supplementary Note 4. 
To further confirm the nature of digital layer-by-layer etching, Raman spectra 
were also recorded for a twice-etched sample, which contains 0C, 1C and 2C etched 
areas, as shown in Fig. 2h. It is well known that the thickness of few-layer TMDCs can 
be determined from the distance of their characteristic Raman modes25,26. With the 
decrease in MoS2 thickness, the distance between the 𝐸2g
1  and A1g modes is decreased 
accordingly. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2h, the distance values for the three 
contrastive areas amount to 23.6 cm−1, 22.2 cm−1 and 19 cm−1, which correspond to 
the thickness values of 3L, 2L and 1L, respectively. These consecutive numbers of 
thickness provide unambiguous evidence for the accurate thickness control featuring 
monolayer precision and the way as digital tailoring in the process. 
Since this etching method finds its roots in the diffusion and removal of Al atoms, 
which may reside on the surfaces of the as-etched materials, it is also important to check 
the lattice quality and trace of Al residues atop the materials. To cast light onto this 
issue, we also performed atomically resolved top-view STEM and EDS elemental 
analyses for as-etched MoS2 monolayers, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 12 and Fig. 
2i–l. In a series of atomic STEM images, we performed a statistical analysis to estimate 
the gross vacancy density of about (1.3±0.6)×1013 cm-2, without ruling out the extra 
bombardment effect from the electron irradiation during STEM imaging. This value is 
comparable to (1.2±0.4)×1013 cm-2, the value reported in high-quality exfoliated 
sheets27, indicating the negligible invasiveness of our etching technique. In Fig. 2i, the 
EDS spectrum collected over large-area reveals that the trace of Al residues, located at 
1.49 keV, is below the instrumental uncertainty of 5%. Elemental mappings for Al, Mo 
and S also indicate there is no detectable Al signals (Fig. 2j), as compared with the 
strong Mo and S signals (Fig. 2k, l). Note that the sparse bright pixels in Fig. 2j arise 
likely from the “background” chamber contamination and random noise of the imaging 
system. Detailed discussion can be found in Supplementary Fig. 13. Besides, XPS 
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 14) also supports the conclusion that the trace of Al 
residues is negligible.  
Alternative method for defect engineering. As far as surface defect engineering 
is concerned, besides the Ar plasma irradiation, there are also various methods to 
introduce vacancies into the topmost layer, such as thermal decomposition. We tested 
this method by pre-annealing for 1 h the freshly exfoliated MoS2 samples at 400 °C, a 
temperature near the critical point for the escape of sulfurs on the surface, before Al 
deposition. Under such a pre-annealing condition, the density of sulfur vacancies is 
greatly enhanced at the MoS2 surface, although the surface exhibits no remarkable 
change under optical microscope (Supplementary Fig. 15a). As a result, after the lowtemperature annealing together with a sacrificial Al strip at 250 °C for 0.5 h 
(Supplementary Fig. 15b) and acid wash, the topmost layer is clearly removed, as 
shown in Supplementary Fig. 15c. We note that this process would not take place 
without the artificial defects introduced by proper pre-annealing. Hence, the thermal 
decomposition of the surface sulfur atoms via pre-annealing also represents an 
appropriate defect engineering strategy that result in the layer-by-layer etching, as it 
follows the concept of selective etching. 
Multiple digital etching. For both lab and industrial applications, complex 
patterning and multiple etching steps are highly sought after. Next, we demonstrated 
the possibility of applying this procedure repeatedly to construct complex patterns 
when combined with electron beam lithography (EBL). Figure 3a shows the optical

image of a checkerboard-like pattern on a MoS2 sheet that is defined by alternatively 
applying the etching procedures (defect engineering via Ar plasma irradiation) along 
the vertical and horizontal directions. According to such patterning motifs, local areas 
with the three consecutive numbers of layers n, n-1, and n-2 are constructed, where n 
is the numbers of unetched layers. The success in this patterning characterized by 
consecutive numbers of layers, can be clearly seen by means of optical, AFM, and 
Raman characterizations. According to previous research25, the ratio of the Raman 
modes of MoS2 to Si substrate can be used to discern samples characterized by a few 
stacked TMDC layers with number of layers up to 10. In Fig. 3b, c, we mapped the area 
ratio of the Raman modes of 𝐸2g
1  and A1g to Si, respectively, where the checkerboardlike pattern is clearly seen.  
Second-harmonic generation (SHG) response28, being a sensitive probe for the 
lattice symmetry of thin TMDCs, was also employed to verify the variation of number 
of layers. It has been shown that MoS2 sheets with odd numbers of layers display a 
significant SHG response while those with even numbers of layers exhibit almost zero 
response. Figure 3d displays the SHG mapping for the sample; it exhibits alternative 
light and dark patterns along the vertical and horizontal directions, in good accordance 
with the checkerboard-like pattern. All these characterizations indicate that our soft 
etching technique is atomically precise in achieving uniform layer-by-layer etching, 
with no obvious residues after each etching step. 
We also exploited this method to various TMDCs with more delicate patterns to 
demonstrate its universal applicability. Figure 3e–g portrays the optical images of 
patterned logos of Nanjing University on three different TMDCs: MoS2, WS2 and WSe2, 
respectively. The nearly identical logo patterns imply that the concept of selective 
etching is likely applicable for various TMDCs and van der Waals materials, if they 
can be treated in appropriate conditions to ensure required defect density in topmost 
layers, temperature and duration of thermal diffusion, concentration of wash solution, 
etc. Raman and photoluminescent spectra were also employed to characterize pristine 
and etched WS2 and WSe2 sheets, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 16. All data support 
the validity of our method.  
Electronic evidence for non-invasive etching. In order to evaluate the effect of 
extra lattice defects and Al residues on the overall electrical quality, cryogenic electrical 
characterizations were carried out on as-etched MoS2 layers. After etching, the 
remained MoS2 samples were transferred and encapsulated by two ultraclean hexagonal 
boron nitride (h-BN) dielectrics and standard Hall geometry was adopted to estimate 
its intrinsic electrical performance, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. Figure 4a shows 
typical transfer curves (four-terminal conductivity σ versus 𝑉g ) for an FET channel 
made from as-etched 4L MoS2 at different temperature (T) vales from 10 to 300 K. The 
device exhibits high current on/off ratios of 109−1011 , suggesting that the 
semiconducting nature is well preserved in the as-etched sample. The curves intersect 
around 𝑉g ~ 0, indicating the emergence of metal-insulator transition upon modulating 
carrier concentration. This behavior is consistent with that reported in high-quality 
samples29 and confirms again the preservation of high crystallinity after etching.  
 In Fig. 4b, we plot intrinsic carrier mobility (𝜇) versus T to further discern the 
effect of carrier scattering from Al residues. At low T, 𝜇 becomes saturated at ~1200 
cm2V-1s-1. This value is consistent with exfoliated samples29. At high T, 𝜇 follows a 
power law with T ( 𝜇∝𝑇−𝛾 with 𝛾~1.83) in the log-log plot. Theoretical studies on 
pure phonon scattering predicts an exponent 𝛾~1.69 and ~2.6 for 1L and bulk MoS2, 
respectively30. However, the addition of Coulomb impurity scattering will degrade 𝜇 in 
6 / 16

the entire T regime and, as a result, reduce 𝛾 largely. For instance, 𝛾 ~ 0.62−0.72 were 
reported in SiO2 supported monolayer MoS2 samples31,32. The 𝛾 value in our device is 
reasonably within the range of theoretical prediction, suggesting the dominancy of 
scattering from lattice phonons and the negligibility of effect from Coulomb impurities 
such as Al residues. The entire 𝜇−𝑇 trend of the as-etched samples is comparable to 
that of h-BN encapsulated exfoliated counterparts29, thus it can be inferred that the acid 
wash can remove nearly all the Al residues and provide a clean and fresh surface for 
the as-etched samples.  
Finally, we analyze the transport mechanism of the etched layer based on the 
variable T transport characteristics. As previously reported31,33, due to the atomic 
thickness, the surface disorders, such as the adsorbates atop and substrate charges 
underneath, tend to cause Anderson localization, especially at low carrier densities. 
Even in the case of highly crystalline materials, the presence of a high density of 
localized states in the band-gap region can lead to variable-range hopping carrier 
transport behavior in few-layer MoS2. To gain further insight into the transport 
mechanism, we plot in Fig. 4c σ versus T in terms of the modified 2D Mott variablerange hopping (VRH) equation31,33

where A is a constant, m is the coefficient normally adopted as 0.8 for 2D TMDCs, and 
𝑇0 is the characteristic temperature. The parameter 𝑇0 is related to the localization 
length 𝜉(𝐸) which can be used to qualitatively estimate the degree of disorder, and can 
be described as 
𝑇0 =
13.8
𝑘B𝜉2(𝐸)𝐷(𝐸),                                                    (2) 
where 𝑘B is the Boltzmann constant, and 𝐷(E) is the typical density of trap states from 
interfacial residues. The fitted values of 𝑇0 is plotted versus 𝑉g in the inset of Fig. 4d. 
𝑇0 keeps fixed around 300 K, which is 1-3 orders lower in magnitude than the values 
reported in literature31,33, indicating the large localization length and insignificant 
disorders induced by Al residues. This feature corroborates further the insignificance 
of the extrinsic disorders introduced by Al residues.  
 
In summary, we have devised a selective etching protocol enabling the atomically 
precise and non-invasive layer-by-layer etching of 2D van der Waals materials, based 
on thermal diffusion and subsequent alloy dissolution of a local metal sacrificial layer. 
Such an etching protocol addresses the challenge of non-invasive tailoring material 
thickness with an atomic precision. This technique is universal, being applicable to 
different van der Waals TMDC materials, as it only requires the van der Waals materials 
to be stable in acid or basic solutions. The realization of atomic precision in the etching 
process and the high crystalline quality of the as-etched layers (i.e., surface morphology 
and electronic transport) is demonstrated by a series of characterization means 
including HR-STEM, AFM, Raman, SHG response, and T variable electronic 
measurement. Our protocol for in situ layer-by-layer etching is easily up-scalable, thus 
suitable for both lab and industrial applications.

exfoliated from corresponding crystals and transferred to Si substrates with a 90 or 285 
nm SiO2 capping layer. 
Etching procedure. At first, the exfoliated TMDC layers were spin coated with a 
layer of A4 PMMA electron resist and the areas to be etched were then exposed by 
EBL, transferred to an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) chamber for Ar plasma 
irradiation. The ICP chamber was initially pumped to a base vacuum of 8×10-3 Pa and 
was then filled with a constant Ar flow of 10 sccm till the working pressure of 0.5 Pa. 
The TMDC samples were then irradiated in Ar plasma at an ICP generator power of 30 
W and an idle CCP biasing power for 30 s. The CCP power was set in the idle mode in 
all experiment to minimize plasma energy and the attacking depth. The energy of Ar 
plasma is about 60–70 eV. Subsequently, the Al sacrifice strips were deposited on the 
TMDC samples by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.7–1.2 Å/s. A thickness of 10 nm 
was employed to ensure complete coverage of the areas to be etched. After liftoff, the 
TMDC samples partially covered with the Al strips were then annealed under a 2 torr 
nitrogen atmosphere. The annealing recipe for the layer-by-layer etching is 250 °C for 
0.5 h, while the recipes for the control experiments are 250, 300 and 350 °C for 1 h to 
determine the diffusion depths of Al into MoS2 at different temperatures. Finally, the 
annealed samples were immersed into dilute hydrochloric acid (~16 %) for 0.5 h, to 
completely remove the unreacted Al and its alloy with TMDCs, and then were rinsed 
in deionized water multiple times. 
Raman and SHG mapping. Raman spectra were acquired at an excitation 
wavelength of 488 nm with a power of 22 mW. The integration time was 5 s when 
collecting spectra for individual points and was reduced to 1 s in the mapping mode to 
avoid loss of focus during the long-time collection. SHG was excited by a 1550 nm 
fiber laser with an 80 MHz repetition rate. The laser power is set at 100 mW and the 
integration time used is 100 ms. 
HR-STEM imaging. The cross-sectional STEM samples were fabricated by a liftout method using focused ion beam technique (FEI Helios 600i dual-beam system). The 
STEM lamellas were thinned down to a thickness below 100 nm using a beam current 
of 0.79 nA at 30 kV, followed by gentle milling with a beam current of 72 pA at 2 kV. 
The top-view STEM samples for atomic imaging were prepared by direct transfer of 
as-etched MoS2 monolayers from Si substrates onto 300-mesh copper STEM grids 
through polymer PMMA as transfer medium. HR-STEM HAADF images and EDS 
mapping were acquired on a double aberration-corrected FEI Titan Cubed G2 60-300 
S/TEM at 60 kV equipped with a Super-X EDS detector.  
Device fabrication and characterization. The mechanically exfoliated MoS2 
samples were firstly transferred by Poly-(propylene carbonate) (PPC) films from 
Si/SiO2 substrates onto ultraclean h-BN flakes exfoliated on other Si/SiO2 substrates, 
followed by our non-invasive etching method to remove the top layer. Then, few-layer 
graphene Hall electrodes that were pre-etched were picked-up by top h-BN flakes 
supported with PPC/PDMS bilayers. Subsequently, the PPC layers were heated till 
softened to release the h-BN/graphene bilayers as the top encapsulator/electrode onto 
the as-etched MoS2/bottom h-BN bilayers to form the target h-BN/graphene/MoS2/hBN structures. Afterwards, electrode vias were selectively opened on the top h-BN 
layers by standard EBL and CF4 plasma exposure to expose the graphene Hall 
electrodes. Finally, steps of EBL and metallization of 10 nm Ni/50 nm Au were carried 
out to wire out the graphene Hall electrodes for electrical characterization. Electrical 
measurements were performed in vacuum at 10−5 Torr using a probe station (CRX6.5K, Lake Shore) and two Keithley 2636B sourcemeters. The values of four-terminal 
field-effect mobility of as-etched MoS2 channels were calculated by using the equation

1. Preparation of cross-sectional STEM specimens 
The cross-sectional STEM specimens were fabricated by a lift-out method using 
focused ion beam technique (FEI Helios 600i dual-beam system). The Al/MoS2 stacks 
were firstly prepared on SiO2/Si substrates, followed by appropriate thermal annealing. 
Supplementary Fig. 1a, b shows the optical images for typical samples after annealing 
at 250 and 300 ℃, respectively. Before FIB milling for preparing the cross-sectional 
slices for STEM imaging, metal Pt was deposited onto the Al/MoS2 stacks to protect 
samples from ionizing radiation during ion milling. Panel c and d show the 
corresponding cross-sectional slices for the overall quintuple-layer Pt/Al/MoS2/SiO2/Si 
stacks for Panel a and b, respectively. Each layer can be discerned from enlarged SEM 
images, as shown in Panel e and f. 
 
2. Uncontrollable diffusion between Al and pristine MoS2 
Supplementary Fig. 2 shows an extended (~1 μm wide) cross-sectional HR-STEM 
image for a typical Al/MoS2 (pristine) stack annealed at 300 °C for 1 h, which provide 
a chance to understand the mechanism of interlayer diffusion and alloying between the 
sacrificial Al and pristine MoS2 layers. The density of surface defects on the pristine 
MoS2 is believed to distribute uniformly within the lattice, since it is a freshly exfoliated 
sheet with high quality. Hence, the thermal diffusion of Al atoms into the MoS2 lattice 
is expected to be spatially uniform without showing obvious difference along the entire 
cross section.  
However, a mixed combination of diffused (circled by dotted write lines) and 
undiffused areas (showing sharp boundaries), with roughly equal distribution 
probabilities, are observed in the extended HR-STEM image shown in Panel a. Such 
non-uniform thermal diffusion behavior can be attributed to the formation of local 
defects at initial annealing stage, which facilitates subsequent Al diffusion into the 
defective local MoS2 lattices. Likely, less defects are believed to be present in the 
undiffused areas and the relative integrity of the lattices hinders the diffusion of Al.  
Panels b and c show the enlarged HAADF images for the diffused and undiffused 
areas, respectively. In Panel b, 6 layers of MoS2 exhibiting expanded layer spacings 
can be clearly seen in the alloy area. Most expanded layers (the bottom 4 layers) remain 
parallel to each other, indicating the interlayer diffusion between Al and MoS2 is quite 
an order process. At such an annealing condition (300°C, 1h), Al consumes MoS2 up to 
6 layers and the length of interlayer diffusion reaches ~10 nm. In Panel c, sharp layer

boundaries and no expanded MoS2 layers are observed at the Al/MoS2 interface in the 
HAADF image of the undiffused region, implying that no obvious Al/MoS2 alloy is 
formed.  
 
3. Fluctuation of diffusion depth in pristine MoS2  
For the stacks of Al and pristine MoS2 annealed at 300 ℃ for 1 h, we find that there 
is variation in diffusion depths ranging from 3 to 6 layers in the alloy areas. Typical 
cross-sectional HAADF images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, where the diffused 
and delaminated MoS2 layers are indicated by the numbers from 1 to 6, counted from 
the topmost to the bottom layers. The Diffusion depths are 3L, 4L, 5L, 6L from Panel 
a to d, respectively. The fluctuation in diffusion depth of 3-6 layer can be attributed to 
the overall inhomogeneity caused by multiple imperfect surfacial and crystallographic 
factors from involved materials, including inhomogeneously condensed absorbates on 
MoS2 surfaces, non-uniform thermal stress, randomly distributed point and line defects 
inside MoS2, and even the polycrystalline orientations of Al. 
Hence, it would be very difficult to well control the depth of diffusion and thus 
etching in pristine TMDCs without defect engineering. To improve the controllability 
in diffusion depth, appropriate defect engineering is necessary. 
 
4. Estimation of lateral resolution in digital etching 
It is possible to estimate the length of lateral diffusion of Al directly from the profiles 
of the bird-beak shaped alloy edges. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows the typical profiles of 
the beak edges with different penetration depths, all formed at annealing condition of 
300 ℃, 1 h. We plot in Panel a, for instance, the critical diffusion terminals at the beak 
edge (P1, P2, P3) and the directions for Al diffusion. By assuming P0 is the starting 
point of diffusion, the diffusion velocities are Vab and Vc along the lattice ab- and cdirections, and P1, P2, P3 are also the terminals of lateral diffusion at each layer counted 
from the topmost 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Indeed, all the terminals comprise the profile 
lines of the beak edges, which is much clearer in Panels e and f when the penetration 
depth is larger. The lateral distances from the terminal of the bottom layer (P3 in case 
of Panel a) to those of the upper etching layers are labelled as dn where n = 1, 2, 3…, 
representing the number of upper layers counted from the topmost. For simplicity, we 
use d0 to label the etching distance in the last layer, that is the lateral distance between 
the terminal of the bottom layer (P3 in case of Panel a) and the starting point of etching

(P0). Hence, the overall diffusion distance of Al at each layer can be written as d0+dn, 
where d0 is unknown but dn can be accurately measured from the STEM images.

the bottom layer to those of the upper etching layers.

By taking the selective of the overall diffusion distance, we can finally obtain the 
individual diffusion distance (dn+1-dn, or dn for the last layer) for each etching layer, 
which represents exactly the lateral diffusion distance of Al at the specific layer when 
Al penetrates a monolayer vertically along c direction. Thus, the lateral resolution at 
the topmost layer is 1.5±0.3 nm under the annealing condition of 300 ℃, 1 h.

It is likely that the issue of lateral diffusion of Al would arise at elevated annealing 
temperatures (above 300 ℃) or in case of deep etching (removal of several layer at one 
cycle). However, we have managed to lower the annealing temperature to the safe value 
at 250 ℃ by using the defect engineering, and we etch only a monolayer at one cycle.  
 
5. Theoretical estimation of diffusion energy 
To justify the concept of selective etching and to confirm the effect of TMDC 
surface defects on interlayer diffusion, theoretical calculations on diffusion barriers are 
carried out for two types of MoS2 lattices: defective and perfect, as shown in 

===== Page 21 =====

5 
 
Supplementary Fig. 5. The calculations are based on methods as follows. Density 
functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the VASP package. The 
electron-ion interactions were evaluated by using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) 
pseudopotential. Exchange-correlation interactions were considered in the generalized 
gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and HeydScuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) methods. The van der Waals interactions were described by 
using the DFT+D2 scheme. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method 
was used to find minimum energy paths. 
For simplicity, we only considered the diffusion process of one Al atom. Panel a 
shows the schematic diagram for the ideal thermal diffusion process for an Al atom into 
a defective MoS2 bilayer with one S vacancy on the surface. The potential curve at 
different coordinates of the MoS2 lattice is schematically plotted on the right. Panels b 
and c show the estimated diffusion barriers for defective and perfect bilayer MoS2 
lattices, respectively. Theoretical calculations indicate that the diffusion barrier for the 
individual Al atom via sulfur vacancies into the defective MoS2 lattice is about 90 meV 
(Panel b), corresponding to the movement of Al atom from the position A to C in the 
schematic potential curve in Panel a. The atomic configurations between Al and MoS2 
in different reaction states, i.e., initial/transition/final state (IS, TS, FS), are also given 
in Panel b. Panel c shows the diffusion potentials of IS and FS for Al into perfect MoS2 
bilayers, where a relatively high diffusion barrier of 750 meV is estimated. This value 
is more than 8 times higher than that in a defective lattice. According to the Fick’s 
second law of diffusion, an 8-fold variation in diffusion barrier corresponds to a huge 
difference of 106 in thermal diffusion coefficients at 250 °C. Such a huge difference in 
diffusion coefficient constitutes the rationale behind the selective etching concept.  
 
6. Mechanism of thermal diffusion 
According to the Fick's second law of diffusion 
∂𝐶
∂𝑡= 𝛁∙(𝐷𝛁𝐶)1, where 𝐶 is the 
concentration of Al atoms in alloy, 𝑡 is the diffusion time of duration and 𝐷 is 
diffusion coefficient, the behavior of thermal diffusion of Al can be well described by 
solving the diffusion equation above. In the diffusion theory, 𝐷 depends on annealing 
temperature 𝑇𝑎 following the Arrhenius relation 𝐷= 𝐷0 ∙exp⁡(−
Δ𝐻
𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑎), where 𝐷0 is 
a coefficient to be determined from experiment, Δ𝐻 is the activation enthalpy of 
diffusion, and 𝑘B is the Boltzmann constant.  

===== Page 22 =====

6 
 
Using a continuum model for van der Waals materials (Supplementary Fig. 6), we 
can simply estimate the distribution of Al concentration along the diffusion direction. 
Since the deposited Al film (10 nm) is much thicker than Al/MoS2 alloy region, we 
further assume the Al source is an infinite reservoir and its concentration keeps constant 
at the Al/MoS2 interface during the whole diffusion process. By combining the 
boundary conditions, the Fick's diffusion law for Al distribution into MoS2 can be 
simplified as 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐶s ∙erfc (
𝑥
2√𝐷𝑡), where the 𝑥 is the diffusion distance along 
the one-dimensional flux direction (as shown in Panel a), 𝐶s is the constant surface 
concentration at x = 0, and erfc(
) is the complementary error function. By 
substituting the exact expression of D, the function of Al concentration can be written 
as 
𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡, Δ𝐻, 𝑇𝑎) = 𝐶s ∙erfc (
𝑥
2√𝑡∙𝐷0∙𝑒
−Δ𝐻
𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑎
). (1) 
By applying the experimental observation that the penetration depth is 6L for defective 
areas annealed at 300°C for 1h and assuming that 𝐶(6L) = 0.1⁡𝐶s⁡(cutoff criterion), 
we can extract 𝐷0 = 4.3 × 10−17⁡cm2s−1.  
Accordingly, we estimate that at 250 °C the diffusion coefficients for Al into 
defective and perfect MoS2 lattices are 5. 9 × 10−18⁡cm2s−1 and 2.6× 10−24⁡cm2s−1 
respectively, which features a difference of 6 orders in magnitude. Panel b shows the 
normalized concentration of Al as a function of diffusion depth for various samples and 
annealing conditions, with taking the concentration value 0.1⁡𝐶s as the diffusion cutoff 
(dashed line in Panel b). Within such a criterion, the diffusion depth for Al into 
defective MoS2 is about 4L at the annealing condition of 250 °C, 0.5 h, while it is almost 
zero into perfect MoS2. The theoretical calculations further justify the proposed concept 
of selective etching. 
 
7. Optimizing pretreatment conditions 
In experiment, we found that the ICP power of 30 W (CCP biasing power: idle 
mode) is almost the lowest parameter to excite stable Ar plasma in our facility and 
hence we adopted this value as the power parameter. In addition to theoretical 
calculation, we also cross-over tested the etching results for the surface pretreated MoS2 
sheets under different pretreatment conditions with the duration of plasma irradiation 
(30 W) varying from 20 to 40 s and thermal annealing Ta changing from 150 to 250 ℃. 

===== Page 23 =====

7 
 
Supplementary Fig. 7 a–i shows the etching results that are the optical images for the 
tested samples before and after etching for the 9 conditions used in total. Panel j shows 
the image contrast of the etched areas with respect to nearby substrate areas, which can 
be used to scientifically judge the etching completeness. The criterion is set as 0.99, 
contrast above which standing for a completer etching process without residues. 
The tendency is that samples processed under weak conditions show obvious flake 
remnants (Panels a, b, d and g) or light residues (Panels c, e and h), indicating an 
incomplete etching for a monolayer. In contrast, a monolayer can be completely 
removed under intensified conditions (Panels f and i). Overall, the parameters “30 W, 
30 s and 250 ℃” is concluded as an optimal pretreatment condition. The detailed 
conditions are listed as below. 
1) Generator RF (ICP) power: 30 W (low power to minimize plasma density) 
2) Biasing RF (CCP) power: 0 W (idle mode to minimize plasma energy) 
3) Energy: 60–70 eV (estimated energy obtained from the RF generator) 
4) Flux of Ar+: 4.5×1017 cm-2s-1 
5) Duration of irradiation: 30 s 
6) Dose of Ar+: 1.4×1017 cm-2 
7) Net dose to remove S atoms: 2.2×1014 cm-2 (estimated from XPS) 
8) Etching mechanism: physical bombardment 
 
8. Etching yield under optimized pretreatment conditions 
We performed XPS characterization to estimate the density of removed sulfur 
atoms after plasma irradiation. We cut three monolayer CVD MoS2 samples from one 
wafer and exposed them in Ar plasma (ICP power: 30 W, CCP power: 0 W) under 
different durations from 0, 90, to 180 s. The untreated sample (duration: 0 s) is used as 
reference and extended durations of 90 s and 180 s are employed to increase the 
differences among samples.  
Supplementary Fig. 8 shows the XPS spectra and corresponding fittings for the 
three samples, in order to extract the atomic ratios between S and Mo elements. 
Evidently, the intensity of the S peak located around 227 eV is reduced when the 
irradiation duration increases from 0 to 180 s. In panel d, the extracted S/Mo atomic 
ratio is plotted versus irradiation duration. The ratios are 1.96, 1.42 and 1.20 for samples 
under irradiations of 0, 90 and 180 s, respectively, indicating that the loss of S atoms is 
roughly proportional to plasma duration. A slight saturation emerges under high 

===== Page 24 =====

8 
 
duration, which can be attributed to the reduced probability of physical bombardment 
between S and Ar+ (i.e., reduced etching yield of S atoms by Ar ions) in the highly 
defective samples.  
By assuming a constant etching yield in the first 90 s, for the 30-s irradiation 
condition employed in manuscript, we estimated a S/Mo ratio of 1.78, a removal of 9.2% 
S atoms from the topmost layer, and an effective dose of 2.2×1014 cm-2 by Ar plasma 
to remove S atoms. Together with the flux of Ar+ (4.5×1017 cm-2s-1, ICP: 30 W, CCP: 
0W), we estimated a low etching yield of ~0.16% for removal of S atoms at this weak 
plasma condition. 
 
9. Evidence for sub-monolayer attacking depth of Ar plasma 
To check the realistic attacking depth of Ar plasma and whether it only attacks the 
atoms in the topmost layer, we collected Raman spectra for pristine and irradiated 
monolayers (Supplementary Fig. 9), which show that the signals from lattice vibration 
disappear only above intensified conditions (ICP = 40 W, idle CCP, 50 s). Under the 
condition of 30W (ICP) and 50 s, the Raman signal still survives, indicating such a 
condition cannot destroy the entire lattice. Thus, under the optimized Ar plasma 
condition (ICP = 30 W, idle CCP, 30 s), the attacking depth into chaclogenides is within 
monolayer. 
 
10. Solutions for wet etching 
 In order to verify the universal role of both the acid and basic solutions played for wet 
etching in the final processing step, we show in Supplementary Fig. 10 the results of 
post-etching with three various acids (sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid) and 
one basic (Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide, TMAH) solutions. It proved that all of 
the four types of solutions work for the removal of Al and alloy layers. However, it 
deserves noting that, since the SiO2 substrates can also be etched by strong basic 
solutions, they should be avoided to use in case of SiO2 as substrates. When the 
supported substrates are slightly etched, the TMDC layers above the SiO2 substrates 
would roll up (Panel d) or even be rushed away in the basic solution. Hence, basic 
solutions are compatible only with alkali-proof substrates.

11. Preparation of top-view STEM grids 
Supplementary Fig. 11 shows typical optical images for as-etched 1L MoS2 (Panel 
a) before and (Panels b–d) after transferring onto the STEM grids. Panels b–d show 
the images from low to high magnification ratios. The scale bars are 50, 20, and 10 μm, 
respectively. In Panel b, multiple irregularly shaped MoS2 sheets and a rectangular strip 
of metal Au can be seen. The Au strip is used as label to mark the location of 1L MoS2 
areas to facilitate fast locating during STEM imaging. Panel c shows enlarged image 
covering the Au marker and the MoS2 sheet containing 1L area, while Panel d focuses 
on the 1L MoS2 area that is denoted by dotted lines.  
 
12. Statistics on vacancy density of as-etched monolayers 
Supplementary Fig. 12a, b shows typical high-angle annular dark-field STEM 
(HAADF-STEM) atomic images for local areas of the as-etched 1L MoS2. In the 
HAADF imaging mode, the brightest dots and their adjacent slightly less bright ones 
correspond to the heavy Mo and light S atoms, respectively, as represented in 
Supplementary Fig. 12a. The lattice vacancies, i.e., missing atoms, would appear with 
a reduced brightness as compared to occupied sites, as indicated by the red arrow in 
Supplementary Fig. 12b. Supplementary Fig. 12c plots number of samples versus 
vacancy density and Gaussian distribution was used to fit the data, which reveals an 
average value of 1.3×1013 cm-2 with standard deviation of 0.6×1013 cm-2, respectively. 
 
13. Estimation of uncertainty for top-view elemental mapping 
The uncertainty for EDS elemental mapping for the top-view samples becomes 
higher than that for the cross-sectional samples because of the nature of 1L thickness 
and fewer numbers of atoms involved for analysis. EDS signals for various elements 
including Mo, S, Al, Mg, Ar, Sc, Yb and Gd were carefully collected and some are 
shown in Supplementary Fig. 13b–f. The overall counts collected from detector are 
summarized and compared in Panel g. Among them, the elements Mo and S come from 
the sample and exhibit the strongest EDS signals in terms of the detector counts over 
the whole sampling area. The elements Mg and Ar are likely introduced by previous 
samples and their residues constitute the source of chamber contamination; they show 
less strong signals. Accordingly, the three selected rear-earth elements Sc, Yb, and Gd, 
which have never been directly introduced in the chamber and believed to be absent in 
the chamber, are used for calibrating the noise of imaging detection; they show the 

===== Page 26 =====

10 
 
weakest signals. The element Al, which is the one to be analyzed and shows signal 
intensity between Mg and Ar, can have two sources: sample and chamber 
contamination. In Panel g, we careful analyze the levels of chamber contamination and 
detection noise, as indicated by the blue and green bars, respectively. We estimate that 
the content of Al residues is within the level of chamber contamination. At the most, 
the trace of Al residues is about 5% if only ruling out the effect of detection noise. 
 
14. Check of Al residues with XPS 
We also performed XPS analysis to double check the content of Al residues. The result 
is quite similar to the EDS analysis above that no noticeable Al content is detected. As 
shown in Supplementary Fig. 14, the signal from Al 2p peak (around 74.5 eV) is at the 
level of noise in the XPS spectrum, proving that the Al residue is practically negligible. 
Note that two 100-nm Au pads were placed to mark the as-etched MoS2 flake and also 
used as the reference for XPS analysis. The peak at 84.3 eV is from the excitation of 
the Au 4f7/2 level. 
 
15. An alternative method for defect engineering 
To further verify the crucial role of surface defects played in diffusion 
enhancement, we also tried other methods in introducing surface defects onto MoS2. 
Supplementary Fig. 15 show the results for using pre-annealing as the defect 
engineering. In Panel a, an exfoliated MoS2 sheet was pre-treated at 400 °C for 1 h 
before Al deposition. Then, an Al strip was deposited onto the sheet, followed by 
thermal diffusion at 250 °C for 0.5 h (Panel b) and acid wash (Panel c). The result shows 
that a monolayer of MoS2 was removed successfully and homogeneously, indicating 
that diffusion is indeed enhanced in defective lattices. Hence, pre-annealing can be used 
as an alternative method for interfacial defect engineering. 
 
16. Universality of the etching method 
Besides MoS2, we also applied this method to different TMDC sheets including 
WS2 and WSe2 to check its universality of the layer-by-layer processing. 
Supplementary Fig. 16 shows the Raman and photoluminescent spectra for the locally 
0C, 1C and 2C processed WS2 and WSe2 trilayer sheets. After such consecutive 
thinning, local areas with thickness of 1L, 2L and 3L can be obtained accordingly. Panel 
a shows the Raman spectra collected for the processed local WS2 areas whose Raman 

===== Page 27 =====

11 
 
characteristics resemble those of MoS2; the distance of 𝐸2g
1  (~355 cm-1) and A1g (~418 
cm-1) modes varies with the number of layers, i.e., etching cycles. The values of peak 
distance versus etching cycle are summarized in Panel b. Panel c shows the Raman 
spectra for the processed local WSe2 areas. Their 𝐸2g
1  (~251 cm-1) and A1g (~249 cm1) modes coincide practically with each other and peak distance cannot distinguish the 
information of number of layers any more. It was reported that the second-order mode 
2LA(M) around 260 cm-1 gradually emerges as WSe2 is thinned down from 3L to 1L. 
Also, the 𝐵2g
1  peak of WSe2 shows alternative odd-even dependency with thickness 
decreasing, which is coincided with published result using 488 nm laser2–4. The unusual 
thickness dependence exhibited by the three modes corroborates that the digital layerby-layer etching technique on TMDCs is applicable. 
The PL characteristics of MoS2 and WS2 and WSe2 were also added and listed as 
Panels d-f, respectively, showing a strong PL excitation due to the transition to direct 
band gap when the flakes are etched down to monolayer. All the three thickness 
dependent PL characteristics are inconsistent with the exfoliated counterparts (WS2, 
WSe2: 5; MoS2:6.) reported in literature. 
 
17. Electrical properties of as-etched MoS2 on SiO2/Si 
Systematic electrical characterizations were carried out on the field-effect 
transistors consisted of as-etched MoS2 fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates, as a 
comparison with those etched by other methods and, also, as a reference to those 
supported by ultraclean h-BN substrates. In Supplementary Fig. 17a, b, the transfer 
curves of the 2L and 1L layers reveal average threshold voltage values at 10.5 and 9.1 
V, which are translated into positive doping levels of 2.6 and 2.3 × 1012 cm-2, 
respectively. The appearance of overall positive rather than negative doping effect, as 
expected from Al as electron donor, indicate that the adverse doping induced by the Al 
residues is practically negligible, being much weaker than the impacts from the heavily 
doped silicon gates and surface gaseous absorbates. In addition, both devices exhibit a 
high Ion/Ioff ratio of 108, suggesting that the semiconducting nature is well preserved 
in the as-etched layers.  
The average two-probe carrier mobility (𝜇) of the two devices are calculated to be 
16 and 31 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. These values are comparable to these of exfoliated 
samples with similar thickness values (Supplementary Fig. 17c), thus it can be inferred 
that the acid wash can remove nearly all the Al residues and provide a clean and fresh 

===== Page 28 =====

12 
 
surface for the as-etched samples. In Supplementary Fig. 17c, we also compared the 
𝜇⁡values of as-etched samples treated with various etching techniques, including 
thermal7, laser8,9, and plasma10–12. Apparently, by implementing the concept of 
selective etching, our etching method yields samples with the highest electronic quality 
among the in-situ etching techniques established so far. In other word, our method is a 
truly non-invasive surface etching technique that can preserve the electronic quality to 
the most.  
Electrical characterizations at variable temperature from 10 to 300 K were carried 
out on an as-etched 2L device to evaluate the impact of extra lattice defects on the 
transport mechanism in MoS2. Supplementary Fig. 17d shows its transfer curves at 
different temperatures. The linear plots of Ids in the inset highlight that the metalinsulator transition point of the device is around 37 V. The presence of metal-insulator 
transition at high carrier concentration confirms again the high crystallinity is preserved 
after etching. We also extracted the hopping characteristic temperature 𝑇0 through the 
2D Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) equation. The extracted values of 𝑇0 is plotted 
versus 𝑉𝑔 in the inset of Supplementary Fig. 17e. 𝑇0 ranges from 1.1 × 103 to 
4.9 × 105⁡K , comparable to the values reported in exfoliated MoS2 on SiO2/Si 
substrates13, which indicates that the extrinsic disorder introduced by Al residues is 
insignificant.  
In Supplementary Fig. 17f, we plot 𝜇 versus T to further discern the effect of 
carrier scattering from Al residues. At high T, 𝜇⁡follows a power law with T (𝜇∝𝑇−𝛾 
with 𝛾~0.71) in the log-log plot. At low T, 𝜇 becomes saturated at ~70 cm2V-1s-1. 
Both the values of 𝜇 and 𝛾 are much lower than the counterparts supported by 
ultraclean h-BN, indicating that that charge impurities at the SiO2 surfaces play 
important role. Hence, ultraclean dielectric interfaces are critical for achieving the 
intrinsic performance of as-etched TMDCs.

neglecting the complicated profile of diffusion barrier at different coordinates
of the MoS2 lattices. a, Schematic diagram for the diffusion flux of Al atoms into a
MoS2 lattice. The diffusion direction is assigned as x. b, Calculated normalized
concentration of Al element as a function of diffusion depth for three different
combinations of sample quality and annealing condition. The criterion of diffusion
cutoff is taken as 0.1 𝐶ୱ. Hence, the diffusion depth of Al into defective MoS2
under the annealing condition of 300 °C and 1 h is about 6 layers and is reduced to
about 4 layers under the condition of 250 °C and 0.5 h. For a perfect MoS2 lattice,
the calculated diffusion depth is practically zero under the condition of 250 °C and
0.5 h.

in the flakes with odd number of layers, which is consistent with the results reported in
