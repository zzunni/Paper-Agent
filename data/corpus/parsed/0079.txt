Interstitial defects are inevitably present in doped semiconductors that enable modern-day electronic, optoelectronic or thermoelectric technologies. Understanding of stability of interstitials and
their bonding mechanisms in the silicon lattice was accomplished only recently with the advent of
ﬁrst-principles modeling techniques, supported by powerful experimental methods. However, much
less attention has been paid to the eﬀect of diﬀerent naturally occurring interstitials on the thermal
and electrical properties of silicon. In this work, we present a systematic study of the variability
of heat and charge transport properties of bulk silicon, in the presence of randomly distributed
interstitial defects (Si, Ge, C and Li). We ﬁnd through atomistic lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics modeling studies that, interstitial defects scatter heat-carrying phonons to suppress
thermal transport—1.56% of randomly distributed Ge and Li interstitials reduce the thermal conductivity of silicon by ∼30 and 34 times, respectively. Using ﬁrst principles density functional
theory and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, we compute electronic transport coeﬃcients
of bulk Si with 1.56% Ge, C, Si and Li interstitials, in hexagonal, tetrahedral, split-interstitial and
bond-centered sites. We demonstrate that hexagonal-Si and hexagonal-Ge interstitials minimally
impact charge transport. To complete the study, we predict the thermoelectric property of an experimentally realizable bulk Si sample that contains Ge interstitials in diﬀerent symmetry sites. Our
research establishes a direct relationship between the variability of structures dictated by fabrication
processes and heat and charge transport properties of silicon. The relationship provides guidance
to accurately estimate performance of Si-based materials for various technological applications.

INTRODUCTION
Applicability of any material to optical, energy transport or topological architectures is largely determined by
our ability to design and manipulate defects and doping
in the material that either supply or destroy free carriers. Signiﬁcant advances have been made to understand
the physics and the properties of defects in inorganic
semiconductors, owing to the strong historical interaction between the theory of defects and doping-enabled
semiconductor-based technologies—microelectronics, [1–
4] photovoltaics, [5] light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [6],
and, more recently, spintronics [7] and quantum devices [8, 9].
Design of defect tolerant semiconductors
that can retain their properties despite the presence
of crystallographic defects, is actively pursued for the
next-generation Earth-abundant solar energy conversion
technologies. [10] In contrast, introduction of defectinduced innovative transport mechanisms in bulk [11, 12]
and nanostructured materials [13–16] enabled paradigmshifting advances in the thermoelectric (TE) energy con-
∗sanghamitra.neogi@colorado.edu
version devices. Innovative defect engineering eﬀorts in
future technology-enabling materials heavily rely on a
better understanding of the role of intrinsic point defects
in carrier transport.
In the last two decades, Si-Ge based heterostructures
have emerged as key materials in numerous electronic,
optoelectronic [17–19] and TE devices. [20–23] During
the growth and fabrication of these devices, especially
ones that require high temperature processes, several
undesirable damages [24]—vacancies, interstitials, additional substitutional atoms, clusters—are introduced as
a byproduct. [25] These defects mostly degrade the device performances. [26, 27] It is of great technological
signiﬁcance to consider the variability of the conﬁgurations, dictated by fabrication processes, while predicting
the performance of Si-based materials for various applications. Studies of point defects in Si, introduced through
radiation damage, started in the late 1940s. [24] However, a uniﬁed understanding of stability of interstitial defects and their formation mechanisms was accomplished
only recently, with the advent of ﬁrst-principles modeling
techniques, [28–33] supported by powerful experimental
methods, such as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and deep-level transient spectroscopy. [34–38]

The commonly studied interstitials in the silicon lattice, using ﬁrst principles modeling methods, are selfinterstitials, [29, 30, 39, 40] germanium, [33, 40] carbon, [41–43] and lithium [44–46].
Carbon interstitials
play an important role in the radiation-damage behavior
of silicon. [35] Li interstitials in silicon signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the stability of the host material, and thus, the
applicability of silicon as an anode material in the next
generation lithium-ion batteries. [46] These ﬁrst principles based electronic structure modeling studies primarily
investigated the structural changes, stability and bonding mechanism of defects in the silicon lattice.
Introduction of vacancies and substitutional point defects have been extensively investigated to suppress the
thermal conductivity of bulk silicon. [47–49] Around a
vacancy, lattice relaxation creates additional scattering
sites for phonons. The reduction of thermal conductivity
is thus explained by increased phonon scattering and a
reduction in the mean-free-path of phonons, due to the
relatively high concentration of vacancies (1-4%). [49–
51] However, the number of studies to investigate the
inﬂuence of interstitials on thermal conductivity is fairly
limited. Few studies exist that focused on phonon properties employing Green’s function techniques with approximated force constant based models. [52–56] Interstitials in the context of thermoelectrics have been widely
studied in the form of clathrates and other caged structures. [57] A comprehensive understanding of the eﬀect
of diﬀerent naturally occurring interstitials (Si, Ge, C
and Li) on the thermal and electrical properties of silicon, however, doesn’t exist.
In this work, we present
a systematic study of the variability of charge and heat
transport properties of bulk silicon in the presence of
randomly distributed interstitial defects (Si, Ge, C and
Li), using ﬁrst principles density functional theory (DFT)
and atomistic lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics
(MD) techniques, respectively. This theoretical investigation furnishes indirect measures to estimate the presence of interstitial defects in a sample. Furthermore, our
study establishes a processing-structure-transport (heat
and charge) property map that provides guidelines for
design, synthesis and processing to develop Si-based materials with predictable, robust and optimal performance.
As an illustration of the relevance of this work for practical applications, we discuss the relationship between
the structure dictated by processing and material performance of bulk silicon, with naturally occurring interstitial impurities in the lattice, for thermoelectric applications. Solid state TE generators [58] are expected to play
a key role to meet the rapidly increasing power demands
of the internet of things, by converting any source of
heat into electricity. Defect engineering in TE materials
aims to aﬀect the interdependent heat and charge transport properties toward higher material performance. The
maximum power-generation eﬃciency (η) of a TE material is, η =

, where the
Carnot eﬃciency is the ratio of the temperature diﬀerence between the hot and cold end (Thot −Tcold) to Thot.
The dimensionless ﬁgure of merit, ZT, is the primary
parameter that determines the eﬃciency and is given by
ZT =

κe+κph , where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the thermopower or Seebeck coeﬃcient, T is
the temperature, PF (= σS2) is the power factor, κe and
κph are the electronic and ionic contributions to the thermal conductivity, respectively. [58] Our MD studies show
that interstitial defects scatter heat-carrying phonons to
suppress the κph; 1.56% of randomly distributed Li, Ge,
Si and C interstitials reduce the thermal conductivity of
silicon by ∼34, 30, 20 and 9 times, respectively.
We
provide further insights into the modiﬁcation of phonon
propagation properties in the presence of interstitials by
computing the density of states and group velocities using
lattice dynamics technique. Defects commonly introduce
additional impurity levels within the TE materials energy
band gap, [59, 60] leading to a reduced charge transport.
We investigate the electronic transport properties of bulk
Si with 1.56% Ge, C, Si and Li interstitials in hexagonal,
tetrahedral, split-interstitial and bond-centered sites. We
demonstrate that Si and Ge interstitials in the hexagonal sites minimally impact the charge transport properties of bulk silicon. This combined with the decreased
values of κph leads to a 14 and 17 times improved ZT,
respectively. To complete the study, we predict the thermoelectric property of an experimentally realizable bulk
silicon sample with Ge interstitials in diﬀerent symmetry
locations.
II.
METHOD
In order to elucidate the impact of interstitial defects
on the electronic and heat transport properties of bulk
silicon, we employed ﬁrst principles DFT and atomistic
lattice dynamics and MD techniques, respectively.

4096 host Si (yellow) and 64 interstitial Ge (green) atoms.
The DFT conﬁguration has 64 Si (yellow) and 1 Ge (green)
atoms. The concentration of Ge in bulk Si is 1.56% in both
conﬁgurations.
A.
System details
We investigated bulk silicon conﬁgurations with commonly occurring interstitial impurities: Ge, C, Si, and
Li; the systems studied will henceforth be referred to as
Si-I-X systems (where I ≡Interstitials and X = Ge, C,
Si or Li). Representative microscopic conﬁgurations of
the Si-I-X systems investigated are shown in Fig. 1. The
bulk Si supercell templates were generated by replicating a conventional unit cell (CC) of silicon, which consists of 8 atoms in a diamond face centered cubic lattice
arrangement with side length 5.431 ˚A. The guest atom
species (X) were then inserted in the interstitial sites (I)
of these supercell templates to create the Si-I-X conﬁgurations.
The most widely studied interstitial sites in
bulk silicon lattice, investigated with semi-empirical and
ﬁrst-principle methods, are of hexagonal, tetrahedral,
split-interstitial, and bond-centered type. [29, 30, 33, 39–
42, 44, 45] Previous studies discussed that each of these
sites is energetically favorable for only a speciﬁc set of
guest atoms as interstitials.
Additionally, the stability of interstitials also depends on the charge state of
the defects due to the change in the number of dangling bonds. [28, 30] We investigated electronic transport
properties of relaxed Si-I-X conﬁgurations with neutrally
charged interstitials in each of these stable sites (illustrated in Fig. 2) using DFT. Each of the [2 × 2 × 2] × CC
DFT model supercell conﬁgurations (Fig. 1) has 64 Si and
1 interstitial (I) atoms yielding a 1.56 % concentration of
guest atoms in host Si. The system size was chosen to allow us to study charge transport in a large set of defected

semiconductors with a varied chemical bonding environment. In parallel, to study the extent of disruption of
phonon transport in the presence of interstitial scatterers, we performed MD studies of the Si-I-X systems with
three diﬀerent interstitial concentrations, 0.1%, 0.5%,
and 1.56%. The MD models consisted of several thousands of atoms (≥32768). The system sizes were chosen
to represent bulk systems with low enough interstitial
concentrations realizable in experimental conditions, [23]
as well as to perform a large set of calculations with
reasonable computing expenses. The interstitial sites in
these large replicated MD supercells were generated using
a systematic search algorithm. The algorithm employs
a repulsive pair potential to model interatomic interactions between an interstitial atom and its neighboring
host lattice atoms to identify interstices in materials. [61]
These generated tetrahedral sites were randomly populated with a chosen number of interstitial atoms consistent with the concentration. Three distinct randomized
conﬁgurations were investigated for each concentration.
We obtain the initial conﬁgurations of the Si-I-X systems
by placing all the diﬀerent species investigated (Ge, C, Si,
and Li) at tetrahedral interstitial sites, to ensure a consistent comparison of their impact on thermal properties of
bulk Si. However, as we discuss in the following “Atomistic calculations” subsection, a percentage of these interstitial atoms are likely to populate other sites in the

ﬁnal conﬁgurations following equilibration at 300K, due
to thermal ﬂuctuations.
B.
Atomistic calculations
We analyzed the thermal transport properties of Si-IX systems by performing equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations, with periodic boundary conditions enforced in all three directions to emulate inﬁnite
systems. The interatomic forces between Si, Ge and C
atoms were modeled using the empirical potential proposed by Tersoﬀ. [62] This potential was parametrized
to treat heteronuclear bonds, and to reproduce correctly
the elastic properties of silicon, SiC and its defects, in
particular. To model interactions in the Si-I-Li systems,
we implemented a second nearest-neighbor modiﬁed embedded atom method (2NN MEAM) interatomic potential, which was used to describe interactions in Li–Si alloys [63]. To the best of our knowledge, this potential has
not been employed for thermal property calculations. We
performed several test calculations of thermal conductivities (TC) of bulk Si with the 2NN MEAM potential, and
compared with the TC results obtained with the widely
used Tersoﬀpotential.
We present the computational
details and the comparison, in the following paragraphs.
All systems with interstitials were equilibrated at 300
K to ensure that the stability of the structures is maintained. After equilibration, the initial velocities in the
MD simulations were set to 300K and the systems were
coupled to a Nos´e–Hoover thermostat for 1 ns to decorrelate the systems from their initial conﬁgurations. The
thermostat was then decoupled from the systems so that
the simulations were performed under microcanonical
conditions.
The equations of motions were integrated
with a time step of 0.25 fs to ensure energy conservation over simulation times of several tens of nanoseconds.
We computed the TCs from the ﬂuctuations of the heat
current in EMD simulations, using the Green–Kubo relation [64]: κα = 1/(k BVT 2)
R ∞

dt⟨Jα(t)Jα(0)⟩where α
= x, y, z; kB is the Boltzmann constant, V is the volume
of the system, T is the temperature, and ⟨Jα(t)Jα(0)⟩
is the heat current autocorrelation function along the
direction (α) of heat propagation. The heat current is
computed by J = PN
i ϵivi + 1/2 PN
i,j;i̸=j(Fij · vi)rij +
1/6 PN
i,j,k;i̸=j;j̸=k(Fijk · vi)(rij + rik), where ϵi and vi
are the energy density and velocity associated with atom
i, respectively. F is the interatomic force acting between
atoms separated by a distance r. The heat ﬂux data were
recorded at 5 fs intervals. The total simulation times varied between 15 and 30 ns for diﬀerent conﬁgurations. All
EMD simulations were carried out using LAMMPS software [65].
A known disadvantage of the Green-Kubo formalism
combined with EMD method is that the TCs obtained
might suﬀer from system size dependence. The size converged TC value of bulk Si modeled with Tersoﬀempirical potential is reported to be 196.8 ± 33.3 W/m-K. [66]
However, no such study has been reported for Si described with the 2NN MEAM interatomic potential. [63]
To obtain a reference bulk Si TC described with 2NN
MEAM interatomic potential, we performed simulations
of supercells of increasing volume from [4 × 4 × 4] × CC
to a size [32×32×32]×CC containing 262144 atoms. As
depicted in Fig. 3, we ﬁnd that the converged bulk Si TC
using 2NN MEAM is 122.22±13.81 W/m-K. We will use
this value in the following analysis as our reference for
bulk Si TC, using 2NN MEAM empirical potential. We
ﬁnd that to obtain a converged value of TC, one has to
use simulation cells with at least 32,768 atoms. Each of
the data points reported in Fig. 3 was obtained by averaging over 10 calculations performed with independent conﬁgurations, and the standard deviation is reported as the
uncertainty. Compared to the experimentally measured
TC values (depicted in the blue shaded regions in Fig. 3)
ranging from 130 to 150 W/m-K at 300 K, it can be argued that the bulk Si TC modeled using 2NN MEAM is
in reasonable agreement with the measured values, and
the empirical potential oﬀers a rational choice to model
bulk Si with Li interstitials.
In order to test system size dependence of TCs of Si-IX samples, we computed TCs of two systems, Si-I-Ge and
Si-I-Li, each with two supercells of sizes [8 × 8 × 8] × CC
(4096 atoms) and [16 × 16 × 16] × CC (32768 atoms).
This strategy ensured that we tested the size convergence of TCs of defected Si systems described with two
diﬀerent potentials used in this study, Tersoﬀand 2NN
MEAM. For the two system sizes of Si-I-Ge and Si-I-Li,
the TCs diﬀer by ∼9.8% and ∼9.6%, respectively, which
fall within our method uncertainty limits. In our conservative estimate the dimension of simulation supercell
with minimum system size eﬀects is [16 × 16 × 16] × CC.
Henceforth, all TC computations of Si-I-X systems were
performed using this system size. For each of the three
chosen concentrations of interstitials (0.1%, 0.5%, and
1.56%) in the Si-I-X systems, TCs are averaged over 45
data sets—obtained from 3 randomized conﬁgurations,

C.
First principle calculations
A century of developments in empirical and semiempirical models [67, 68] realized the modern theory
of defects in crystalline solids, based on ﬁrst-principles
electronic structure techniques. [69] The method has
been demonstrated to expose phenomena that can be
readily implemented to optimize the performance of a
broad-range of technology-enabling materials.
We implemented electronic structure calculations with DFT,
using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of
the exchange-correlation functional by Pedrew-BurkeErnzerhof (PBE) [70] as implemented in the plane-waves
code Quantum Espresso (QE), [71] to study the eﬀect of
interstitial species types and their positions on electronic
transport. We employed scalar relativistic normconserving pseudopotentials to treat core electrons of both the
host Si and the interstitial atoms. [71] The Kohn-Sham
orbitals expanded in terms of a plane wave basis set,
had a cutoﬀenergy of 30 Ry for all calculations. A convergence threshold for self-consistency was chosen to be
10−9. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the periodic DFT supercells consisted of 64 silicon and 1 interstitial atoms—
corresponding to 1.56% interstitial concentration in the
bulk (see the “System details” subsection for details).
The supercells were ﬁrst relaxed employing BroydenFletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-newton algorithm with
a 4×4×4 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh [72] to optimize
the lattice constants and the atom positions of the Si-I-X
supercells. Following relaxation, we performed non selfconsistent ﬁeld (NSCF) calculations to obtain the band
energies using a dense k-point mesh. Such sampling is
necessary to converge the calculation of transport coeﬃcients.
The electronic transport coeﬃcients were evaluated
within the framework of semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory [73] as implemented in the BoltzTraP
code. [74] The code employs Fourier expansion to realize
an analytical representation of the band energies, computed with DFT. Using such representations of the electronic band structure and the knowledge of the density of
states, one can evaluate the Seebeck coeﬃcient (S), the
electrical conductivity (σ) and electronic thermal conductivity (κe) and the power factor (PF) (S2σ), in the
diﬀusive regime, by integrating the following expressions
over the ﬁrst Brillouin zone [74, 75]:

where e is the electron charge and V the volume of the
system. The integrand in the expression L(a) consists of
the electron relaxation time τ(k), the electron group velocity ν(k), the a-th power of the Kohn-Sham energies
ϵk with respect to the electronic chemical potential µ(T)
and the derivative of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function (fµ). The transport coeﬃcients obtained using Eq.
(1-4) are tensors: however since transport is isotropic in
the bulk, we report only the trace of S, σ and κe divided
by three. Our tests showed that NSCF calculations performed with a 15×15×15 k-point mesh were suﬃcient to

converge the transport coeﬃcients of the 65 atom Si-I-X
systems under investigation.
It is computationally very expensive to compute the
electron relaxation time τ(k) from ﬁrst principles for our
systems. We adopt the constant relaxation time approximation (RTA), that assumes that the relaxation time τ
depends only on the carrier concentration and is independent of ϵ and k. With this approximation τ can be
factored out of the integrals in Eq. 1, so that it cancels
out in the expression of S (Eq. 3), while it remains as a
prefactor in the σ and κe expressions (Eq. 2, 4). In RTA
τ can be estimated using the experimental values of electron (hole) mobility [76] and eﬀective masses [77], which
is known for bulk silicon.
We employed a further assumption that small (∼1%) concentration of interstitials
does not aﬀect the electron relaxation times signiﬁcantly
and compute σ and κe using τ values obtained from bulk
silicon data. [76, 77]

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We now turn to discuss the main focus of this work
which is to determine how the presence of interstitials
aﬀect heat and charge transport properties of bulk silicon.
We performed a series of EMD simulations (see
the “Method” section for details) and computed the TCs
of Si-I-X systems with varied concentrations of interstitials. After establishing a series of results with MD simulations, we analyzed the bonding environments of the
interstitials to analyze and interpret our data.
Additionally, we used lattice dynamics (LD) calculations to
understand the propagating character of phonons. Lattice dynamics calculations are essential to gain insights
into the modiﬁcation of the phonon properties of bulk
silicon with interstitials. In particular, we computed the
vibrational density of states of Si with interstitial defects
in tetrahedral sites, as well as the propagating character
of the phonons of the defected systems. In parallel, we
systematically investigated charge transport properties
of systems with a wide range of conﬁgurations, incorporating various guest species and a number of interstitials
symmetry sites for each type. Finally, we combined the
phonon and electron transport properties to establish a
structure-processing-ﬁgure-of-merit map of bulk silicon
with interstitials.

As evident from Fig. 4, the TC is lowered signiﬁcantly
upon the addition of a small fraction of interstitials,
independent of the species type. Remarkably, even with
a concentration of 0.1%, there is a ∼2 (C)–4 (Li)-fold
reduction in the TC from the bulk value (196.8 ± 33.3
W/m-K). The decrease in TC is more pronounced with
increased interstitials concentrations, as expected.

general trend of decrease in the TC is noted as Si-I-Li <

in the TC between systems with diﬀerent guest atoms
with a small (∼0.1%) concentration of interstitials. The
spread in TC decreases with increased concentration of
interstitials—randomly dispersed 1.56% Li, Ge, Si and
C interstitials decrease the TC of bulk Si by ∼34, 30, 20
and 9 times, respectively. It is interesting to note that
the phonon transport in bulk Si is aﬀected more in the
presence of Ge interstitials (Fig. 4) than the widely
employed Ge substitutions [78] for similar guest species
concentrations, by a signiﬁcant amount. This suggests
that interstitials oﬀer a strategy to eﬀectively scatter
phonons by tuning the mass and size of the guest atom,
and thereby achieve phonon-glass paradigm to engineer
next-generation thermoelectric materials.
B.
Bonding environment analysis
To understand the inﬂuence of interstitials on phonon
transport, we analyzed the bonding environment of the
guest atoms in the Si-I-X systems. In Fig. 5 we present
nearest-neighbor (NN) environment analysis of Si-I (a)
-C, (b) -Si, (c) -Ge, and (d) -Li systems. In this analysis,
we investigated [8 × 8 × 8] × CC (4096 atoms) Si-I-X supercells with 1.56% interstitials. This concentration corresponds to 64 guest interstitials in a supercell. For each
guest type, we computed the distance between a given interstitial atom and the eight NN Si atoms, to make sure
that we include all ﬁrst NNs in the analysis. A hexagonal
interstitial site has maximum number of NNs, 6, in the
silicon lattice. Therefore, the total neighbor count is 512
(= 64 × 8) in the supercell containing 4096 atoms, in a
conservative estimate. The neighbor distances are sorted
in ascending order over all interstitial atoms in the supercell and displayed in Fig. 5. From the panels (a), (b)
and (c) we mark a gap in the neighbor distance curve
and infer that this gap indicates the division between
the ﬁrst and the second NNs. The number of the ﬁrst
NNs increases with increasing the size of the interstitial
atom (Fig. 5)—average ﬁrst NN distances in Si-I-C, -Si,
and -Ge are estimated as 2.04 ± 0.2 ˚A, 2.27 ± 0.28 ˚A,
2.53 ± 0.18 ˚A, respectively.
The diﬀerent number of the ﬁrst NNs and the uncertainty in the neighbor distances indicate that the interstitials reside in a dynamic bonding environment due
to temperature ﬂuctuations.
The NN analysis manifests that the interstitials access other symmetry positions during the MD simulations even though the initial
conﬁguration consisted of only four-coordinated tetrahedral sites. This was the reason to check 8 NN distances
in the previous bonding environment analysis as well. An
interesting aspect that can be noted from Fig. 5 is that
there is no clear separation between the ﬁrst and the
second NN distances in Si-I-Li unlike the other systems
investigated. Therefore, we do not report an estimated
ﬁrst NN value for this system. This disparity illustrates
that Li interstitials are more diﬀusive in character leading to signiﬁcant disorder in the lattice; which is likely
to be the reason for Li interstitials being the most eﬀective in lowering bulk Si TC as compared to Ge, C, or
Si. One other likely origin of dissimilar NN environment
of interstitial atoms is strain. In these materials, atoms
with dissimilar masses and sizes compared to the host
atoms (other than Si-I-Si) are randomly placed in interstitial sites, leading to anisotropic strain in the material.
The strain could further contribute to disparate relaxation that results in diverse bonding environment of the
interstitial atoms, leading to varied impact on TC.
Interstitial atoms potentially serve as scattering centers that reduce the mean free path of phonons. It can
be argued that the individual atoms as well as the diverse local structural environment caused by distribu-

tion of interstitials, play a critical role in lowering the
bulk Si TC. In order to investigate the eﬀect of distribution of interstitials on TC, we investigated two sets
of [8 × 8 × 8] × CC (4096 atoms) Si-I-X supercells with
1.56% Ge and Li interstitials: one set contains conﬁgurations in which the interstitials were uniformly placed in
tetrahedral sites, the other contains conﬁgurations with
randomly populated sites. As shown in Table I, we ﬁnd
that the TCs of Si-I-Ge-uniform samples are ∼2 times
higher than the Si-I-Ge-random samples. On the contrary, there is no noticeable diﬀerence between the TCs
of Si-I-Li-uniform and Si-I-Li-random samples. Our NN
analysis shows that the individual bonding environments
for the 64 interstitials in the equilibrated (at 300K) Si-IGe-uniform samples are similar within statistical ﬂuctuations. However, that is not the case in Si-I-Li-uniform
samples due to the diﬀusive character of Li in Si; the
distribution of interstitials in the equilibrated conﬁgurations is no longer uniform. Li atoms diﬀuse through both
the uniform and random sample during equilibration to
yield a randomized distribution of local strain in the bulk
yielding similar TC. Nevertheless, it is important to note
that addition of Ge interstitials considerably lowers TC
with reduction comparable to Li, despite lacking the diffusive character. Overall, considering the stability of the
material we infer that Ge interstitials oﬀer a promising
route to decreasing TC of bulk Si.
C.
Phonon properties
In order to characterize the transformation of Si heat
carriers in the presence of interstitials in Si-I-X systems,
and to analyze the TC decrease trend (Ge < Si < C), we
carried out a series of lattice dynamics (LD) calculations.
In a bulk material, TC can be modeled using the kinetic
theory of thermal diﬀusion, which relies on an approximated solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport
equation. The 3 × 3 thermal conductivity tensor can be

the phonon group velocity vector along the Cartesian direction α, and τλ(q) is the phonon lifetime.
Previous
studies computed eigenfrequencies of localized phonon
modes and phonon density of states of Si with interstitials defects (Si, O, C, B, Li) in tetrahedral sites, using
Green’s function techniques. [54] However, only isolated
interstitials were considered, therefore, the results cannot be compared. We computed the phonon dispersions
ωλ(q) of Si-I-X systems by direct diagonalization of the
dynamical matrix of a 8 × 8 × 8 × CC (4096 atoms) supercell with 1.56% randomly dispersed interstitials (as
described in the “System details” subsection). The sum
in equation Eq. 5 is implicitly aﬀected by the vibrational
density of states (VDOS) of the system; we computed
the VDOS of Si-I-X systems by integrating the ﬁrst Brillouin zone using a 8 × 8 × 8 Monkhorst-Pack mesh of
q-points [72]. We ﬁnd that there is a slight decrease and
shift in the intensity of the peak related to optical modes
at about 15 THz, as displayed in Fig. 6, however, these

the Si-I-X systems above 3–5 THz and the vg proﬁle is approximately of the order Ge < Si < C. Inset: Phonon group

modes do not contribute greatly to heat transport. Previous calculation of phonon density of states also reported
a shift in the intensity in the high frequency region, as
well as a peak near ∼4 THz.
However, only one interstitial defect was considered in this calculation, and
simplifying assumptions were made that the interstitials
are weakly bound to the host atom, and therefore, should
not disturb the local symmetry appreciably. [52]
In order to analyze the propagating character of the
phonons, we compute the group velocities. The phonon
group velocity term plays a dominant role in the TC
expression (Eq. 5) and hence, can help us to make a
qualitative prediction of TC of the material. The gradient of the frequency ωλ(q) with respect to wavevector q
yields the group velocity vector vλ(q), i.e., vg = vλ(q) =
∂ωλ(q)/∂q. In Fig. 7, we show the phonon group velocities in Si-I-C (blue), -Si (orange) and -Ge (green) systems, along the symmetry direction [000]−[100] of the supercell in comparison with bulk (black). We ﬁnd that the
phonon group velocities above 3–5 THz are greatly decreased in defected systems with respect to those in bulk
crystalline Si (approximately 1 order of magnitude) due
to the presence of interstitials. In fact, the suppression of
group velocities has a direct correspondence with the TC
decrease trend (Ge < Si < C), as illustrated by our MD
simulations (see Fig. 4). As can be noted from Fig. 7, the
vg values in between 3-5 THz are least suppressed in SiI-C systems, when compared with Si-I-Ge systems. The
reduction of vg, especially in the low frequency region,
plays a dominant role in heat transport and is directly
responsible for the diﬀerence in TC values between the
systems (Ge < C, see Fig. 4). The group velocities of SiI-Si and Si-I-Ge have a similar proﬁle yielding similar TC
values. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the phonon group velocities along the symmetry direction [000]−[100] in Si-IGe systems with uniform (magenta) and random (green)
distribution of interstitials. The group velocity proﬁle of
the Si-I-Ge-random system is lower than the corresponding system with uniform distribution of Ge interstitials,
yielding a ∼2-fold reduced TC, as reported in Table I.
D.
Electronic transport
In this section, we illustrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent interstitials in varied lattice symmetry positions on electronic transport properties of Si. The drastic reduction
of TC of bulk silicon with the introduction of interstitials makes this a promising materials engineering strategy for thermoelectric applications. However, in order
to achieve a high ﬁgure of merit (ZT) and attain the
phonon-glass-electron-crystal regime, it is important to
not only decrease TC but to simultaneously maintain
a high power factor (PF). Previous studies with semiempirical and ﬁrst-principles methods demonstrated that
the energetically stable interstitial sites in bulk silicon
are of hexagonal, tetrahedral, split-interstitial and bondcentered type (see Fig. 2). [29, 30, 33, 39–42, 44, 45] We
computed the charge transport properties of the Si-I-X
systems (X = Ge, C, Si or Li) with interstitials in each
of these possible energetically stable sites. Table II displays the total energies of the Si-I-X systems with speciﬁc
atom species X (listed in the leftmost column) in varied
interstitial sites of Si, computed with DFT. We assigned
a reference value (0.00 eV) to the lowest energy across
each row and presented the energies in the neighboring
columns in the same row with respect to this reference.
The split-interstitial sites in Si-I-Si (and -Ge) and Si-I-C
systems are considered to be along the [110] and [100]
cubic lattice symmetry directions, respectively. The results displayed in Table II indicate that split-interstitials
are the most energetically favorable sites in Si-I-Si, -
Ge and -C systems, while Li atoms are more stable in

tetrahedral sites at 0K. These results are in good agreement with previous theoretical calculations. For Si selfinterstitials, the split and the hexagonal sites are reported
to be the ﬁrst and the second most stable geometries,
respectively, with insigniﬁcant diﬀerence in energies between them. [29, 30, 40, 79] Split-interstitial sites were
also demonstrated to be the equilibrium positions for Ge
and C defects in the silicon lattice. [33, 40–42] And, a
binding energy analyis reported that Li is most stable in
a tetrahedral site. [44] However, our MD studies reveal
that interstitials are highly likely to access diﬀerent sites
due to temperature ﬂuctuations. Therefore, it is safe to
assume that all the sites with energy values reported in
Table II are equally probable due to temperature ﬂuctuations and random defect distributions in a sample.
We decided to compute charge transport properties of
only the systems that are stable and have total energies
within 1 eV compared to the most energetically favorable system in the same row. The systems represented
by the empty gray cells in Table II didn’t satisfy these
criteria and therefore, were omitted from further investigation.
Some of the stable Si-I-X systems exhibited
semiconductor-like behavior (blue) while other exhibited
metal-like behavior (white). We discuss the properties of
the semiconductor-like systems in the next paragraphs
followed by the metal-like systems.
To illustrate the role of the diﬀerent interstitials on
charge transport, we calculate the transport coeﬃcients
S, σ, κe and the power factor (S2σ) as functions of the
carrier concentration, ne, and compare with the corresponding values of bulk silicon. Fig. 8 shows the electronic transport coeﬃcients of semiconductor-like Si-I-X

systems (blue cells in Table II) for the n-doping case at
300K. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the transport coefﬁcients are signiﬁcantly altered due to the presence of
the interstitials. Both Si-I-Si and -Ge systems with splitinterstitials have a smaller S compared to bulk Si, while
other interstitials leave S relatively unaltered. Introduction of the interstitials consistently decreases both σ and
κe. All Si-I-X systems except Si-I-C-hexagonal have similar values of the conductivities; a hexagonal C interstitial
yields the lowest σ and κe. The combination of S and
σ yields a small PF for the Si-I-C-hexagonal system as
well as Si-I-Si and -Ge systems with the split-interstitials.
However, the power factor of Si-I-Si and Si-I-Ge approach
the power factor of bulk silicon at high carrier concentrations. The electronic transport coeﬃcients were evaluated within the framework of semi-classical Boltzmann
transport theory [73] as expressed in Eqs. (1-4). Therefore, it is essential to examine the factors in the argument
of the integral in Eq. 1, for a complete understanding of
the eﬀect of interstitials on the charge transport coeﬃcients.
In the following, we discuss the details of the electronic
band structures and the density of states (DOS) that
determine the transport coeﬃcients. The left panel of
Fig. 9 shows the band structures of the semiconductorlike Si-I-X systems (blue cells in Table II). All interstitial
impurities introduce additional levels within the energy
bandgap. The levels close to the band edges (either conduction band minimum or valence band maximum) are

referred to as “shallow” levels and those far away from
the band edges as “deep” levels. [59] The band structures
of Si-I-Si (panel (a)) and -Ge (panel (b)) are very similar. Interstitials in hexagonal sites in these two systems
introduce two deep levels in the valence zone and few
shallow levels in the conduction zone. The same species
in the split-interstitial sites create two deep levels in the
valence zone with one deep and a few shallow levels in the
conduction zone. It is known that the energy gap computed from Kohn-Sham states is systematically underestimated. [80] However, it does not aﬀect the calculation
of transport coeﬃcients because we only study transport
properties of the highly doped n-type materials, therefore, the integrations in Eq. (1-4) are performed over the
energy bands in the conduction zone. The deep levels in
the conduction zone decrease transport coeﬃcients due to
the ∂f /∂ϵ factor in the integrand as shown in Eq. (1). In
general, deep levels lead to poor electron (hole) transport
properties because of the low density of available states
in the region close to the conduction (valence) zone edge
(see Fig. 9). That is the reason the hexagonal interstitials
induce better charge transport in the n-type Si-I-Si(-Ge)
(Fig. 8 (solid orange (green) line)) rather than the splitinterstitials (Fig. 8 (orange (green) dashed line)). On the
other hand, C-interstitials in hexagonal sites introduce
one deep level in both the valence and the conduction
zones (panel (c)-top). The deep level in the conduction
band leads to poor transport properties as shown in Fig. 8
(blue solid line).
Interestingly, C-interstitials in bondcentered positions do not add any deep levels within the
band gap (panel (c)-bottom) and yield better transport
properties (Fig. 8 (blue dashed line)).
In order to understand the origin of the deep and the
shallow levels, we compute the local density of electronic
states (LDOS) of Si-I-C systems, shown in Fig. 9 panel
(d). LDOS describes the space-resolved electronic density of states that is computed using postprocessing projwfc.x code available through QE package. LDOS allows
us to quantify the contributions from interstitial and host
atoms separately to the full electronic density of states.
Figure 9 panel (d)-top shows the comparison between
the density of states contributed by the C-interstitial
(blue) and the host Si atoms (normalized by the number of Si atoms) (orange). The peaks in the LDOS indicate that C-interstitials primarily contribute to the additional deep and the shallow levels, in both hexagonal and
bond-center sites. The two peaks (panel (d)-top, blue) in
LDOS close to the Fermi level correspond to the deep levels in band structure in Si-I-C-hexagonal systems, while
two distinguished peaks ∼0.5 and ∼0.7 eV (panel (d)-
bottom, blue) are directly related to the shallow levels in
the Si-I-C-bond-centered systems.

Introduction of the interstitials consistently decreases
both σ and κe.
All Si-I-X systems except Si-I-Chexagonal have similar conductivities lower than bulk Si,
as can be seen from Fig. 8; a hexagonal C interstitial
yields the lowest σ and κe. Lowered conductivities might
stem from the additional deep levels which lead to the reduced density of available states in the region close to the
conduction zone edge. The combination of S and σ yields
a small PF for the Si-I-C-hexagonal system as well as Si-ISi and -Ge systems with the split-interstitials. However,
the power factor of the Si-I-Si(and -Ge)-hexagonal systems approach the power factor of bulk silicon at high
carrier concentrations. We obtained the thermoelectric
ﬁgure of merit ZT of the Si-I-X systems at 300K (Figure 9 right panel) by combining the electronic transport
coeﬃcients with our MD κph results, shown in Fig. 4.
Since κph is strongly suppressed in the presence of the
interstitials, we see a signiﬁcant improvement of ZT for
all Si-I-X systems studied in this work compared to bulk
Si.
The highest ZT are obtained for Si-I-Si and -Gehexagonal systems due to a combination of low κph’s and
high PFs. 1.56% of Ge interstitials in the hexagonal sites
are found to improve ZT of bulk Si by a factor of 17. The
lowest ZT value is found to be for Si-I-C systems with
interstitials in the hexagonal sites. Even for this case the
ﬁgure of merit is 3 times larger than the reference bulk
value [81].
As we discussed in the preceding text, interstitials introduce additional energy levels in the band structure.
Both the deep and the shallow levels lead to smaller energy gaps of the Si-I-X systems. We now turn our attention to the systems marked with white cells in Table II.
The interstitials not only shrink the energy bandgaps of
these systems but greatly alter the electronic properties
rendering them metal-like. In Fig. 10 we present the band
structures of the metal-like Si-I-X systems (white cells in
Table II): Si-I-Si, -Ge and -Li in the tetrahedral sites and
-C in the split-interstitial sites. (The interstitial conﬁgurations are as depicted in Fig. 2.)
In the Si-I-Si(-Ge
or -Li)-tetrahedral systems (panel (a), (b) and (e)) the
energy gap is minimally altered but the Fermi level is
shifted so that it intersects the conduction bands—such
behavior resembles the band structures of highly doped
n-type semiconductors.
The band structures of Si-I-Si
and Si-I-Ge in tetrahedral positions (panel (a) and (b))
are rather similar.
The interstitials not only shift the
Fermi level but introduce additional shallow energy levels in the conduction zone. In comparison, Li interstiW

We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the band structures
between Si-I-Li-tetrahedral and -hexagonal systems. In
order to avoid redundancy, we refrain from displaying the
Si-I-Li-hexagonal band structure in this article. The SiI-C-split-interstitial system exhibits a combined eﬀect of
smaller energy gap due to additional deep energy levels
(similar to Si-I-C-hexagonal system shown in Fig. 9) and
shifted Fermi level leading to metal-like characteristics.
We present the LDOS of the metal-like Si-I-X systems
in the rightmost panel of Fig. 10 to discuss the origin
of the additional bands. Comparison between the LDOS
of Si-I-Ge and Si-I-Li tetrahedral systems (panel (c) and
(f)) shows that Ge interstitials (green) are responsible for
creating shallow energy levels in ∼−0.2−1 eV range. In
contrast, Li interstitials (magenta) do not create distinct
peaks either in conduction or valence zones. This can be
explained by the fact that Li has fewer electrons than Ge
and Si atoms. For the same reason, Li interstitials do
not aﬀect the band structure signiﬁcantly. The orange
curves in Fig. 10 represent contribution of host atoms
to the DOS, scaled with respect to the total number of

Si atoms. Additionally, we analyzed the projected density of states in Si-I-Ge tetrahedral system, and found
that the additional conduction bands created are mostly
formed from the p-electrons of the guest atom. These results indicate that interstitials oﬀer a viable strategy to
design n-type semiconductors without explicit dopants,
e,g, substitutionally doped bulk silicon with pentavalent
impurities such as phosphorus.
We acknowledge that in experimental samples the interstitial atoms are likely to reside in diﬀerent symmetry
positions (e.g., hexagonal, tetrahedral) within the crystal
due to the variability of the neighbor bonding environment and temperature ﬂuctuations. In order to simulate
an experimentally realizable system, we turn to investigate the electronic properties of a Si-I-X system containing interstitial atoms in diﬀerent symmetry sites. The
system consists of 128 Si host atoms and 2 Ge interstitials, one in the hexagonal and the other in the tetrahedral symmetry position. Thus we maintain a 1.56% concentration of interstitials within bulk, consistent with the
cases discussed thus far. In Fig. 11 we present the band
structures of Si-I-Ge (a) -hexagonal, (b) -tetrahedral and
(c) -combination of hexagonal and tetrahedral conﬁgurations. As can be noted, the combined system (panel
(c)) preserves features from both individual cases (panel
(a) and (b)).
Hexagonal Ge interstitial introduce two
additional levels in the energy gap closer to the valence
band edge and additional shallow levels in the conduction zone (panel (a) and (c)), while tetrahedral Ge shifts
the Fermi level to conduction zone and introduces additional shallow energy levels in the conduction zone (panel
(b) and (c)). To calculate the ﬁgure of merit of the SiI-Ge system with interstitials placed in both hexagonal

The highest ZT value was found for Si-I-Ge-hexagonal

SUMMARY
In summary, we performed a systematic study of the
eﬀect of naturally occurring randomly distributed interstitial defects (Si, Ge, C and Li) on the charge and heat
transport properties of bulk silicon, using ﬁrst principles DFT and atomistic lattice dynamics and MD techniques, respectively. Our atomistic modeling, using empirical potential, reveals that interstitial defects do not
signiﬁcantly alter the phonon density of states.
However, the group velocities, and therefore the propagation
of phonons, are strongly suppressed (∼1 order of magnitude). Previous studies reported an additional low frequency peak in the density of states. However, the calculations only incorporated isolated interstitials interacting
with simpliﬁed neighbor forces, therefore, the results cannot be compared. The reduction of group velocities follows the trend: Ge < Si < C, leading to a decrease in the
TCs following the same order: Si-I-Ge < -Si < -C, with
Ge having the most and C the least impact in lowering
the TC, respectively. Li interstitials are diﬀusive in character leading to signiﬁcant disorder in the lattice. This is
likely to be the reason for Li interstitials to lower bulk Si
TC the most. Randomly dispersed 1.56% Li, Ge, Si and
C interstitials decrease the TC of bulk Si by ∼34, 30, 20
and 9 times, respectively. This suggests that interstitials
oﬀer a viable approach to achieve controlled phonon scattering, due to the tunablity of mass and size of the guest
atom, and thereby achieve phonon-glass paradigm to engineer next-generation thermoelectric materials.
In parallel, we investigated the electronic transport
properties of bulk Si with 1.56% Ge, C, Si and Li interstitials in hexagonal, tetrahedral, split-interstitial and
bond-centered sites. We demonstrate that Si and Ge in
the hexagonal sites minimally impact the charge transport properties of bulk silicon. This combined with the
decreased values of κph leads to 14 and 17 times improved
thermoelectric ﬁgure of merits without introduction of
explicit dopants, respectively. Our results illustrate that
electronic transport in defected systems strongly depends
on the symmetry positions of defects in the lattice. For
example, the bonding environment of split Ge interstitials is marked with the smallest ﬁrst NN distance 2.3
˚A(obtained from DFT relaxation).
The LDOS reveal
that the interstitials introduce two deep levels in the valence zone and one deep and few shallow levels in the
conduction zone. The deep level (conduction) leads to
reduced charge transport properties compared to pristine
bulk Si. In comparison, Ge in a hexagonal site, bonded
with the ﬁrst NNs at a distance 2.43 ˚A, introduces two
deep levels in the valence zone and only shallow levels in
the conduction zone. The shallow levels result in a better
charge transport. A tetrahedral Ge interstitial, on the
other hand, pushes host NN silicon atoms father away
to a distance 2.5˚A, yielding a shifted Fermi level resembling a highly doped n-type semiconductor. When the
Ge interstitial is loosely bound to its ﬁrst NN, it tends to
create additional shallow energy levels. A tightly bound
split interstitial leads to deep levels in the band structure that diminishes electron transport. This qualitative
understanding, however, may not be generalized to all
defects.
We acknowledge that it may not be possible to control
the symmetry locations of the interstitials in an experimental sample. We compute the properties of an experimentally realizable silicon system, comprised of both a
hexagonal and a tetrahedral Ge interstitial defect. We
illustrate that the defects in this system display an additive behavior: the Fermi level is shifted (characteristic
of a tetrahedral Ge) as well as additional shallow levels
are introduced in the conduction zone (due to hexagonal Ge). Our modeling data furnish indirect measures
to estimate the presence of interstitial defects in a sample. For example, electronic DOS can be measured with
STM techniques. [82] The observed band gap and the
presence of deep/shallow levels in the STM data can be
compared with our theoretical results, to estimate the
defects present in the system, and to accurately predict
performance of Si-based materials for various technological applications.
Our research establishes a direct relationship between the variability of structures dictated
by fabrication processes and heat and charge transport
properties.
We envision that the processing-structuretransport (heat and charge) property map will enable
further developments of silicon-based materials with predictable, robust and optimal performance.
