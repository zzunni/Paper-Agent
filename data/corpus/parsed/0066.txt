Colloidal lithography [1] is how patterns are reproduced in a variety of natural systems and is 
used more and more as an efficient fabrication tool in bio-, opto-, and nano-technology. 
Nanoparticles in the colloid are made to form a mask on a given material surface, which can then 
be transferred via etching into nano-structures of various sizes, shapes, and patterns [2,3]. Such 
nanostructures can be used in biology for detecting proteins [4] and DNA [5,6], for producing 
artificial crystals in photonics [7,8] and GHz oscillators in spin-electronics [9-14]. Scaling of 
colloidal patterning down to 10-nm and below, dimensions comparable or smaller than the main 
relaxation lengths in the relevant materials, including metals, is expected to enable a variety of 
new ballistic transport and photonic devices, such as spin-flip THz lasers [15]. In this work we 
extend the practice of colloidal lithography to producing large-area, near-ballistic-injection, sub10 nm point-contact arrays and demonstrate their integration in to spin-photo-electronic devices. 
Patterning of materials at sub-10 nm dimensions is at the forefront of nanotechnology and 
employs techniques of various complexity, efficiency, areal scale, and cost. Electron beam and focused 
ion beam techniques are typically limited to feature sizes of tens of nanometers, if the features are to be 
well defined, and are rather inefficient for large-area nano-patterning since both methods employ series 
point-by-point pattern transfer. Two promising techniques of nano-imprint lithography [16,17] and 
extreme ultra-violet interference lithography do indeed open for exploration sub-10 nm nanostructures 
[18]. The instrumentation required, however, can in many cases be of great complexity and cost. 
Recently, membranes of nano-porous anodic aluminum oxide [19] were shown to scale to sub-10 nm 
dimensions and potentially compete with the above advanced lithographic techniques at this scale. 
Another potential alternative for sub-10 nm patterning is colloidal lithography, which is very attractive 
at larger dimensions due to its ease of use and low cost. Colloid-based patterning is known to be 
capable of producing individual sub-10 nm objects. However, ordered large-area nano-arrays fully 
integrated into photonic or electronic devices have not been demonstrated using colloidal lithography. 
In this work we use a self-assembled monolayer of polystyrene nanoparticles, reduced in size by a

novel etching process, which enables sub-10 nm feature sizes with large-area coverage in a welldefined hexagonal lattice and full integration for electrical circuit biasing and read out. We demonstrate 
the new fabrication technique using spin-torque and spin-flip photoemission material combinations, 
considered promising for GHz oscillators and THz lasers.  
Self‐assembled monolayer of nanoparticles 
 
The most widely used colloidal lithography medium is polystyrene nanoparticles in aqueous 
solution. Such colloidal solutions are commercially available with a variety of concentrations and 
particle sizes [20]. We have used a range of diameters (down to 40 nm) and found the most consistent 
results in terms of self-assembly for 200 nm diameter and 2% particle concentration. There exist 
different methods of forming a monolayer of colloidal particles on a surface [21]. We found spinning 
the polystyrene colloidal water solution to yield good results. In calibrating the speed and duration of 
the spinning we aimed at forming the largest-area continuous monolayer possible. Thus, spinning in 
three stages, 500 rpm for 10s, 1000 rpm for 30s, and 2000 rpm for 10 s, facilitates self-assembly and 
yields continuous nanoparticle monolayers of hundreds of micrometers in area. This was sufficient for 
our purposes to demonstrate a wide range of integrated device sizes.  
 
The first step of the spinning sequence allowed the particles to gently segregate onto the 
substrate and, to a large extent already here, form a hexagonal pattern.  The second step of spinning at a 
higher rpm-speed prevented formation of additional layers of vertically stacked particles. The last step 
was used to remove the remaining solution, predominantly in the corners of the sample.  
The spinning process was developed using SiO2 substrates, about 2x2 cm2, covered with a 10 
nm thick Au layer. Prior to spinning the substrate was etched in plasma oxygen for 2 minutes in order 
to make the surface hydrophilic [22]. As an alternative route, we found that a good quality monolayer, 
with a well-defined long-range order, can be obtained if a small amount of Triton X surfactant [23] is 
added into the colloidal solution. However, the subsequent extensive tests showed that the use of Triton 

===== Page 4 =====

X is problematic for later processing during the device integration steps. Traces of Triton remaining on 
the surface produce residue that prevents reliable integration. We therefore selected the route of 
forming large-area self-assembled monolayer arrays of nanoparticles by making the substrate 
hydrophilic with the help of RIE plasma oxygen.  
Figures 1a and 1b show the tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of a typical 
monolayer, with the particle diameter (and the inter-particle distance) of 200 nm. The monolayer film is 
of good quality, with only minor defects on the large scale (Fig. 1a). On the small scale (Fig. 1b) the 
lattice clearly is hexagonal.  The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample in Fig. 1c 
shows that the nanoparticle array has a nearly perfect close-packed hexagonal lattice.  The dispersion in 
the particle size at 200 nm diameter is small (approximately 1%), which favors the translation of the 
hexagonal pattern over large areas, hundreds of microns in the case of our optimized self-assembly 
process. 
Downscaling to sub‐10 nm  
Our process of down scaling the particles of the polystyrene monolayer to the 10-nm range consists of 
4 main steps, illustrated in Fig. 2. Once the monolayer is formed (Fig. 2a), reactive oxygen plasma is 
used to reduce the size of the particles (Fig. 2b).  When the desired particle diameter is reached, a 
reinforcing layer of Aluminum is deposited, as shown in Fig. 2c, which in the later process stages acts 
as a hard mask. A lift-off of the particles by etching completes the fabrication of the nano-mask, as 
illustrated in Fig. 2d. The very sensitive process step of the downscaling the particles is reactive plasma 
etching, which must be done in a very clean chamber [23] in order to have a uniform reduction in the 
particle size across the large-area array. The final particle diameter is found to be a smooth function of 
the etching time, so the feature size of the nano-mask can be controlled rather precisely. The typical 
etching power used is relatively low (50 W) to avoid potential disruptive etching at higher power. The 
key process detail, that we found to be critical for achieving sub-10 nm resolution, is a superposed 

===== Page 5 =====

inducted coupled plasma (ICP) of relatively high power (250 W), which increases the ionization in the 
chamber, translating into a more isotropic reduction in the particle size. As a result, the polystyrene 
particles remain nearly spherical during the process, even as their size is reduced by more than an order 
of magnitude. The Oxygen pressure was found to be optimum at 40 mT.  
A typical monolayer after the etching procedure is shown in Fig. 3, imaged by AFM for etching 
quality, surface topography, and particle size. The height of the particles is measured accurately, but not 
the diameter since the convolution of a small particle and the tip produces a widening distortion. 
Keeping all the process parameters constant and varying only the plasma-ICP etching time, we 
reproduce the general result of previous studies [2] of a gradual reduction in the particle size. Figures 
3a,b,c, show the particle monolayer after etching for 165, 180, and 195 seconds, respectively. The key 
advance made in this work, compared to the results on colloidal lithography reported to date, is that our 
modified process scales to sub-10 nm dimensions.  For example, for the etching time of 2 min 45 s 
(Fig. 3a) the particle diameter is reduced to 10-15 nm (measured by AFM with particle-tip deconvolution). For 3 min etching time the average diameter is below 10 nm (Fig. 3b). Etching for 3 min 
15 s reduces the average size further but induces some perturbations. Already at 3 min 30 s etching 
time the monolayer is significantly over-etched and the pattern is partly removed. The true size of the 
particles can be estimated using AFM traces, such as those shown in Fig. 3d. The size of the particles 
here is smaller than the actual curvature of the AFM tip, obtained from scanning calibration samples to 
be approximately 50 nm. Therefore, a de-convolution procedure was used to obtain the particle sizes 
stated above, which compare well with those obtained using SEM (see below). The AFM height is a 
more direct measurement and shows approximately 30 nm for 2 min 45 s and 15 nm for 3 min etching 
time. Figure 3 thus illustrates the fine control of the particle size at ~10 nm by varying the plasma 
etching time.  
The technological viability of the obtained polystyrene nano-particle array depends on the 
ability to transfer it into a reliable mask to be used in subsequent nano-device integration. The most

straightforward approach, used widely in the literature for larger particle-size patterns, would be to 
directly etch the underlying substrate (e.g., SiO2 or Au) using the particle-array as the mask. Our 
extensive tests showed, however, that the particle-mask itself is significantly modified during this 
process, which makes the pattern transfer at the desired 10-nm-diameter range essentially impossible. 
We therefore developed an additional lift-off process step to reinforce the mask. It includes a deposition 
by e-beam evaporation of a 15 nm thick Al metal layer onto the etched particle array, with a subsequent 
lift-off step to remove the polystyrene particles, and yields the hard mask illustrated in Fig. 2d. 
Chemically removing the particles using acetone and mechanical polishing did not work. Another 
technique tested with only partial success was heating the sample just bellow the melting point of 
polystyrene, where the dilatation coefficient makes the particles expand in volume significantly and 
thereby break-open holes in the Al film. This is a promising technique, however, we found it difficult to 
control the size and shape of the resulting ~10-nm holes opened by polystyrene exploding through Al.  
A successful and stable lift off process at these small length-scales was found to be reactive-ion-etching 
(RIE) with Oxygen, in which the polystyrene particles are first etched predominantly from the sides, 
where the Al film is much thinner due to the shadowing effect of the e-beam coating of the polystyrene 
spheres. During this RIE etching step the Al film surface oxidizes and forms a hard mask for 
subsequent ion milling. After a 5 min Ar-plasma etch to remove surface residue, 7 min long ion milling 
etches through the 10 nm thick Au layer and slightly into the SiO2 substrate, thus transferring the 
hexagonal pattern of sub-10 nm polystyrene particles into sub-10 nm pattern of holes in Au on SiO2. 
The Al-oxide layer acts as the hard mask in this process.  
Figure 4 shows SEM images of a typical nano-hole array mask. Long-range order is maintained 
over the micrometer range, as shown in Figs. 4a,b. The process was repeated many times and showed 
good reproducibility. The average inter-dot distance is 200 nm, corresponding to the original particle 
diameter (Figs. 4c,d) and the average hole size reaches down to the sub-10 nm range. The SEM data is 
well calibrated and confirms the de-convoluted AFM data discussed above as regards the morphology

of the array and the size of the particles, throughout the process.  
Device integration 
Having developed a reliable process for producing nano-dot array masks scalable to sub-10 nm 
dimensions, we next demonstrate their integration into advanced spin-photo-electronic devices, such as 
new types of nano-oscillators [9-14] and the newly proposed lasers [15]. The 1-10 nm scale is 
particularly interesting as it enables devices based on non-equilibrium injection, even for metals, due to 
the single-dot size being comparable or smaller than the characteristic relaxation length scales in the 
material. Fabricating and integrating sub-10 nm dot arrays into circuit-driven devices is a non-trivial 
task for any patterning technique (see Introduction) and, to our knowledge, has not been demonstrated 
to date.  
For the spin-laser device of [15], for example, the bottom electrode must be thick to serve as an 
efficient electron and phonon bath under high-current injection. We take that into account in the design 
and start the structure with a sputter-deposited tri-layer of Al(180 nm)/SiO2(15 nm)/Au(10 nm) onto a 
Si/SiO2(500 nm) substrate. The bottom electrode, later to serve as one side of a 10-100 µm range 
optical resonator, is patterned using the standard optical lithography. Specifically, a double-layer resist 
LOR7B(500 nm)/S1813(1.5 µm) is spun onto the Au surface, thermally treated, mask-exposed, 
developed, ion milled for 2 h, and lifted-off in 1165 remover at 60ºC to form a 100 µm wide bottom 
electrode.  
The sample is then cleaned in oxygen RIE for 2 min, which makes the surface hydrophilic, and 
covered with 2-3 drops of the colloid solution forming the polystyrene particle monolayer during the 
above spinning sequence. The particles are scaled down using the multi-step process detailed above to 
form a nano-hole array mask on the bottom electrode surface. RIE plasma etching with CF4 is used for 
2 min for making the contact through the 15 nm thick SiO2 with the 180 nm thick bottom electrode of 
Al. The etching time for 15 nm of SiO2 is 1 min. Using the chemical selectivity of the CF4 etch to SiO2,

we etch twice longer (2 min) in order to form a good undercut in SiO2, which is important for the 
following deposition steps.   
Sputtering was used for deposition of the active point-contact region. The material combination 
was selected to represent the spin-injection laser device [15,24,25], and consisted of a spinmajority/minority ferromagnetic bi-layer Fe0.7Cr0.3(10nm)/Fe(15 nm) [26] capped with Cu(10 nm), for 
spin population inversion injection. We find that the angle of deposition through the 10-nm openings in 
the mask is an important parameter determining the size of the resulting point contacts – the closer to 
normal incidence the closer the resulting contact size to the mask feature size, and the sharper the angle 
of incidence the deeper sub-10 nm the nano-contacts are due to the double shadowing effect illustrated 
in Fig. 5 (direct mask-shadowing and shadowing from material buildup on the mask edge). We used 
two angles of deposition, near-normal incidence and approximately 45-degree incidence, and estimate 
that the average size of the nano-contacts obtained for the angled deposition was approximately 5 nm. 
Finally, surface protection for subsequent processing steps was done with two layers of Cr(5 
nm)/Au(10 nm) deposited by e-beam evaporation. The key elements of the point-contact structure 
obtained are illustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 5a. 
The final integration step is photolithographic patterning of the top electrode, in the case of the 
demonstrator devices below in the shape of a photon resonator for IR-THz photons (Fig. 5a, top panel). 
The process is analogous to the one used for the bottom electrode, but employing a different photomask. The top electrode mask has different diameter disks and half-disks in the range of 10-50 microns. 
The pattern transfer is done by ion milling for 1 h. The etching time was calibrated using surface 
profilometry such as to stop the etch at the Al bottom electrode. The sample was then capped with a 40 
nm thick SiO2 layer for insulation, rotating the sample holder during deposition. Finally, the resist was 
lifted off, and the last step of lithography was using negative resist and depositing a 200 nm thick Al 
top electrode.

Device examples 
The focus of this letter is the new method of integrating sub-10 nm structures into nano-devices. We 
briefly demonstrate the method using two physical effects found in magnetic nano-contacts, namely, 
spin-magnon and spin-photon relaxation. The method is not limited to photonics or spintronics, 
however, and should have a wide application range in various types of physical systems.  
We first estimate the expected circuit characteristics of our typical integrated point-contact 
array. For individual 5-10 nm metallic point contacts the resistance is essentially given by the geometry 
(the so-called Sharvin resistance [27]) and approximately is 20-10 Ω. For an ideal 10x10 μm2 pointcontact array with a 200 nm inter-contact spacing, the number of contacts is 2500. Therefore, the 
expected resistance of the array is of the order of 10 mΩ. A non-ideal array would have fewer contacts 
and therefore higher resistance. Over-etching the polystyrene monolayer and sharp-angle deposition of 
the core material, as discussed in detail above, can result in only a fraction of the array actually 
connected and the individual nano-contact size substantially smaller than the mask feature size of 10 
nm, as measured by SEM and AFM. In this limit we are able to reach the array resistance range of the 
order of 1 Ω. 
We have prepared test samples with the point-contact core made of a single nonmagnetic 
metallic element (Cu with a Cr underlayer), where no effects due to spin-flip relaxation are expected, 
only phonon relaxation (heat). The typical array resistance is measured to be 10-20 mΩ. The currentvoltage characteristic is smooth and approximately parabolic, typical of the expected phonon 
background. Thus, these test data agreed with the expected behavior and showed that the fabricated 
nano-contact arrays are of high quality. 
We next demonstrate a point-contact array with the contacts having a magnetic core. More 
specifically, the core material is a majority/minority ferromagnetic bi-layer of Fe/Fe0.7Cr0.3 [26], where 
due to the opposite spin-polarizations of the two materials at the interface a strong spin accumulation is

expected. The top contact is a half-disk-shaped 10 μm radius Al electrode. Figure 5b is a resistance 
versus bias current characteristic for the device and shows a clear current-induced hysteretic switching, 
typical of magnetic point contacts [28,29], superposed on the phonon background. The mechanisms 
behind is formation of atomic/nano-scale domain walls in the nano-constriction under the spin-transfer 
torque (STT) from the spin accumulation at the Fe/Fe-Cr interface. The switching in both directions 
occurs at one bias polarity, which is characteristic of the STT effect. The change in resistance is 
approximately 2%, typical of domain wall magneto-resistance. The array resistance is of the order of 
10 mΩ, consistent with the expected range for a nearly fully connected sub-10 nm point-contact array. 
Thus, we demonstrate the STT effect in the fabricated nano-devices. The extremely regular array layout 
with the extremely small contact size, as well as the relative ease of the colloidal monolayer process, 
should make this structure very promising for GHz nano-oscillators [9-14]. Optimization would 
involve substituting improved spin-valve materials for the core region and, if needed, tuning the array 
lattice spacing to achieve better spin-wave modes interference.  
Another interesting application of the spin-majority/minority Fe/Fe0.7Cr0.3 contact-core material 
used above is the spin-flip photon emission effect [15,24,25], which requires spin-polarized and nonequilibrium in energy injection and, therefore, near-ballistic point-contact arrays. To achieve this we 
have performed fabrication at the limit in the etching and angle-deposition parameters discussed above, 
for deep sub-10 nm point-contact size and a smaller operating fraction of the array, so that the injection 
voltage per contact is greater than the exchange splitting in the ferromagnetic point contact core (10100 mV, see [24,25] more details). Such high-bias, high-density, spin-polarized injection produces large 
non-equilibrium spin accumulation in the contact core, which allows spin-flip photon-emission 
transitions, vertical in electron’s momentum. A photon emitted by a spin-flip process is contained 
within the resonator and enhanced by the high-dielectric constant, high-transparency SiO2 oxide matrix 
[15]. The lifetime of the emitted photon is long due to the high transparency of the oxide, so the photon 
has a high probability to stimulate another spin-flip transition. At a critical bias, a cascading avalanche

11 
of stimulated spin-flip photon-emitting transitions - a laser action - takes place, generating high-density 
electromagnetic modes in the resonator. This critical photon-emission threshold must manifest itself as 
threshold-type changes in the current-voltage characteristics of our fully enclosed optical resonator. 
Such threshold-type excitations, of giant magnitude, are indeed observed in the device resistance, as 
shown in Fig. 5c. Tis demonstration opens the way to explore a new type of THz lasers based on spinflip photon emission. 
Conclusions 
Colloidal patterning in the form of large-area hexagonal-lattice arrays is demonstrated to scale down to 
sub-10-nm dimensions in the feature size. This is comparable or smaller than the key relaxation lengths 
in various materials including metals, which enables a wide range of new applications in 
nanotechnology. Large-area, near-ballistic-injection point-contact arrays are used to demonstrate 
integration of the developed nanofabrication technique into new types of spintronic and photonic 
devices.
