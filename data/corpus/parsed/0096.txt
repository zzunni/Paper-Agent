The environmental stability of the layered semiconductor black phosphorus (bP)
remains a challenge. Passivation of the bP surface with phosphorus oxide, POx,
grown by a reactive ion etch with oxygen plasma is known to improve photoluminescence eﬃciency of exfoliated bP ﬂakes. We apply phosphorus oxide passivation
in the fabrication of bP ﬁeld eﬀect transistors using a gate stack consisting of a POx
layer grown by reactive ion etching followed by atomic layer deposition of Al2O3.
We observe room temperature top-gate mobilities of 115 cm2V−1s−1 in ambient
conditions, which we attribute to the low defect density of the bP/POx interface.
Black phosphorus (bP) is a direct band gap (Eg = 0.3 eV) semiconductor with a puckered honeycomb layer structure characterized by van der Waals interlayer bonding1,2. The
most thermodynamically stable allotrope of phosphorus, bP exhibits ambipolar conduction,
anisotropic conductivity, and can be exfoliated down to the atomic monolayer limit3–6. Exfoliation of bP in a nitrogen environment followed by encapsulation with hexagonal boron
nitride in a vacuum environment has led to the observation of ∼45, 000 cm2V−1s−1 hole
mobility at cryogenic temperatures7. Importantly, bP is subject to degradation by photooxidation with a reaction rate that increases as bP thickness decreases9.
A number of
passivation techniques have been developed with varying degrees of success, including encapsulation with Al2O310–13, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)7,14,15,17, polymer layers6,8
and functionalization with nickel nanoparticles16. More recently, it has been demonstrated
that the formation of a dense phosphorus oxide, POx, layer by oxygen plasma dry etching
followed by Al2O3 deposition results in stable encapsulation of bP without compromising
photoluminescence (PL) eﬃciency18. The preservation of PL eﬃciency indicates that the
interface between bP and POx does not measurably increase non-radiative recombination
rates and is thus an eﬀective surface passivation strategy.
In this work, we apply the POx passivation approach of Pei et al.18 to fabricate top-gated
bP ﬁeld eﬀect transistors (FETs). The use of a native oxide for passivation and gate stack
formation in bP FETs is appealing as a direct analogue to the use of silicon oxide in silicon
FET technology. Various phases of POx are known, including a rhombohedral crystal of
molecular P4O1019, and the most thermodynamically stable form of P2O5 which is itself a
layered material composed of a hexagonal network of edge connected (PO)3−
4
tetrahedra20.
The POx layer passivates the bP surface, and acts as a seeding layer for subsequent atomic
layer deposition of high-quality gate dielectrics such as Al2O3. We have fabricated dual-gate
bP FETs, a bottom gate formed by a heavily doped, oxidized silicon substrate, and a top
gate structure with a POx/Al2O3 dielectric stack. Room temperature top gate ﬁeld eﬀect
mobilities of up to 115 cm2V−1s−1 are achieved.
In our experiments, we used bP crystals prepared according to the procedure developed
by Nilges et al.27, wherein high-purity red phosphorus (> 99.99%), tin (> 99.999%), and

gold (> 99.99%) are heated in a muﬄe oven with a SnI4 catalyst. The solid product was
placed in a quartz tube, subjected to several evacuation-purge cycles with N2 gas, and then
sealed under vacuum. The evacuated quartz tube was heated to 406◦C at 4.2◦C/min, where
it remained for 2 hours. The tube was then heated to 650◦C at 2.2◦C/min and held at this
temperature for 3 days. The tube was then cooled at 0.1◦C/min. The ﬁnal product is
crystalline bP with a typical crystal size ranging from 0.3 mm × 3 mm to 3 mm × 10 mm.
The bP crystals were mechanically exfoliated in a nitrogen glove box with H2O and O2
levels maintained at < 1 ppm to minimize photo-oxidation during sample processing. The
bP ﬂakes were exfoliated onto either single crystal quartz substrates, or 5 mΩcm As-doped,
(001) Si substrates with 300 nm of dry thermal SiO2. The SiO2 surface was treated with a
hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) layer to suppress charge transfer doping21.
Amorphous POx was grown on both bulk bP crystals and exfoliated bP ﬂakes by reactive
ion etching (RIE) in a custom built chamber with 10 sccm of O2 ﬂow at a chamber pressure
of 200 mTorr with 300 W of RF bias power. Prior to oxidizing the bP samples, the RIE
chamber was cleaned for 15 min with 10 sccm of O2, 200 mTorr pressure and 300 W RF
power. As discussed further below, the RIE process simultaneously oxidizes and etches the
bP. We calibrated the RIE process by etching thick exfoliated ﬂakes as shown in Fig. 1 a)-c).
Stylus proﬁlometer traces were taken before and after RIE processing, with the results of a
17 min etch shown in Fig. 1 b) and c). The estimated etch rate for our process is 0.98 ˚A/s,
which corresponds to an etch rate of 0.18 layers/s taking into account the 5.23 ˚A thickness
per layer1. By comparison, Pei et al. report a comparable etch rate of 0.1 layers/s18. In our
work, typical RIE processing times for thin (< 1 µm) exfoliated bP ﬂakes are 1-3 minutes,
allowing for the growth of POx with minimal etching.
To conﬁrm the formation of POx, a freshly cleaved bP crystal was treated by RIE and
analyzed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) with an Al Kα source. The resulting
XPS spectrum of the P 2p core level is shown in Fig.1(d), showing contributions from both
bP and POx.
The P 2p3/2 peak at a binding energy of 130 eV and spin-orbit split P
2p1/2 peak are in good agreement with previous observations of bP XPS spectra18,24. The
overlapping P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 peaks at a binding energy of ∼134.5 eV are in remarkably
good agreement with previous reports for P2O518,24,25. However, it remains a challenge to
distinguish between the various phases of POx26.
The oxidation process is best understood by the model described by Pei et al.18. In the
RIE process, O2 plasma oxidizes the top layers of the bP, producing a dense POx layer.

FIG. 2. Capacitance measurement. (a) A schematic depiction of a bP FET on a quartz substrate
used for measuring capacitance. (b) An optical micrograph taken before the ﬁnal metalization step
of the device used for capacitance measurement. The device used for the capacitance measurement
had a ∼5 nm thick POx capping layer grown by 3 minutes of RIE. (c) Capacitance versus top-gate
voltage with an AC excitation of 1 mV peak-to-peak at a frequency of 1 MHz.
Once this layer is established, subsequent etching by O2 plasma penetrates the underlying
bP, leading to further oxidation and POx formation, while simultaneously sputtering away
POx. A dynamic equilibrium is established between the sputtering of POx and oxidation
of the underlying bP, such that the POx layer reaches a steady-state thickness.
Pei et
al.18 estimates a steady state thickness of approximately 10 nm after 40 s of oxidation,
approximately twice the 5 nm thickness observed in our experiments (see below).
Notably, POx is a strong hygroscopic desiccant and reacts violently with water. In order
to suppress the reaction of POx with water, we encapsulated the bP/POx ﬂakes with a
3 nm thick layer of Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition, exposing them to trimethylaluminum
(TMA) for 148 seconds before proceeding with 25 ALD deposition cycles. By increasing
exposure to hygroscopic TMA, the bP/POx surface is in a dehydrated state before the
introduction of H2O into the ALD chamber to initiate oxidation of adsorbed TMA.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), was used to characterize the bP/POx/Al2O3
and bP/SiO2 interfaces. An exfoliated bP sample was capped with a POx layer grown for
3 min by RIE followed by a 3 nm layer of Al2O3 grown by ALD. A tungsten layer was
deposited atop the ﬂake for protection during the milling and polishing process. Electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) conﬁrmed the presence of P, Al, and O. Fig. 1(e) displays a
high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld (HAADF) image of the surface of the bP ﬂake. The puckered
honeycomb layers of P atoms in the bP crystal are clearly seen, as well as an amorphous
layer of POx. We speculate that the POx is an amorphous layer of molecular P4O10, but
further work is required for unambiguous determination of the POx phase. The POx layer
thickness is approximately t ∼5 nm.
We measured the capacitance of the POx layer alone as a gate dielectric with bP ﬂakes
fabricated on an insulating quartz substrate. A schematic of the bP device is displayed
in Fig. 2(a). The bP ﬂakes were ﬁrst exfoliated on a quartz substrate and contacted with
Ti/Au (5 nm / 80 nm) electrodes using an electron beam lithography process. The POx was
then deposited by 3 min of RIE. Finally, a second electron beam lithography process was
used to deposit Ti/Au (5 nm / 80 nm) gate electrodes. An optical micrograph of a device
before top-gate metallization is shown in Fig. 2(b). The top-gate capacitance per unit area
CG versus top-gate dc bias voltage VG was measured with an AC excitation of Vac = 1 mV
peak-to-peak at a frequency of 1.00 MHz, and is displayed in Fig. 2(c). At VG = 0 V, the
capacitance per unit area is CG = 0.74 µF/cm2. The gate capacitance is a series combination
of: the capacitance CP Ox of the POx layer; and the gate voltage dependent quantum
capacitance CQ of the hole accumulation layer at the bP surface. The latter capacitance
contribution is approximated from a non-degenerate thermodynamic density of states as
CQ = e2∂p/∂EF ∼e2p/kBT = 6.2 µF/cm2 for an estimated carrier density p = 1012/cm2
at T = 300 K. Consequently, we ﬁnd the POx layer contribution CP Ox = (C−1
G −C−1
Q )−1 =
0.84 µF/cm2. For an estimated POx layer thickness of t = 5 nm determined from TEM
images, the inferred dielectric constant of our POx layer is ϵ = 19ϵ0.
We fabricated devices for ﬁeld eﬀect measurements in a dual gate conﬁguration, similar
to that ﬁrst proposed by Sakaki for velocity modulated transistors23, and recently used to
compare top-gate and back-gate operation in bP FETs22. A schematic of the fabrication

process is shown in Fig. 3(a). A freshly exfoliated bP ﬂake on an SiO2/Si substrate is
displayed in Fig. 3(b). A standard electron beam lithography process was used to deﬁne
Ti/Au (5 nm / 80 nm) source-drain electrodes (Fig. 3(c)). The POx and Al2O3 layers were
then deposited by 3 min of RIE and 25 cycles of ALD. Finally, a second electron beam
lithography process was used to deﬁne Ti/Au (5 nm / 80 nm) top gate electrodes (Fig.
3(d)).
For further protection, bP FETs were encapsulated with polymethylmethacrylic
(PMMA) layers.
Taking into account the capacitance CAl2O3 = ϵ/t = 9.34ϵ0/3 nm =
2.7 µF/cm2 of the 3 nm layer of Al2O3, the top-gate capacitance is estimated to be CT G =
(C−1
G
+ C−1
Al2O3)−1 = 0.58 µF/cm2. The back-gate capacitance is a signiﬁcantly smaller
CBG = ϵ/t = 3.9ϵ0/300 nm = 11.5 nF/cm2.
All electrical measurements were carried out in a vacuum probe station, P < 10−4 Torr using quasi-dc excitation with a semiconductor parameter analyzer. Leakage currents through
the top and bottom oxide layers were measured through-out all measurements, and never
exceeded 5% of the measured source-drain current for all results shown here. Fig. 4 a) and
b) display the I −V characteristics of our highest-mobility POx/Al2O3-passivated device.
The source-drain current IDS versus bottom-gate voltage VBG with ﬁxed top-gate voltage
VT G = 0 V at a source-drain bias voltage VDS = 50 mV at a temperature of 300 K is
plotted in Fig. 4(a). Similarly, IDS versus top-gate voltage VT G with ﬁxed bottom-gate
voltage VBG = 0 V at a source-drain bias voltage VDS = 50 mV is shown in Fig. 4(b). In
both cases, hole conduction is observed, with an on/oﬀcurrent ratio for the bottom-gate
and top-gate modulation of Ion/Ioff ∼30 and Ion/Ioff ∼300, respectively. Noting that
the capacitance ratio CT G/CBG ∼50, the top-gate voltage range −1 V < VT G < +1 V
and bottom-gate voltage range −50 V < VBG < +50 V extend over an induced charge
displacement of approximately ∆D/e = C∆V/e = 7.2 × 1012cm−2.
The ﬁeld eﬀect mobility is determined from the channel conductance GDS = IDS/VDS
by µX = (L/W)(∂GDS/∂(CXVX)), where L is the channel length, W is the channel width
and X refers to either top-gate (TG) or bottom-gate (BG). The room temperature ﬁeld
eﬀect mobilities are plotted in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(d). The peak top-gate mobility of
µT G = 90 cm2V−1s−1 exceeds the peak back-gate mobility of µBG = 60 cm2V−1s−1 in the
same bP FET. The POx/Al2O3 top-gate is thus seen to give 10-fold improvement in on/oﬀ
current ratio and a 50% improvement in peak ﬁeld eﬀect mobility over the SiO2 back-gate.
In the case of both top-gate and back-gate modulation seen in Fig. 4(c) and (d), the ﬁeld
eﬀect mobility falls to a negligible value at positive bias due to the depletion of hole density
and subsequent loss of conductance modulation. At negative bias, channel conductance
saturates due to the parasitic eﬀects of access resistance and contact resistance, suppressing
transconductance and leading to an under-estimation of ﬁeld eﬀect mobility. The saturation
of conduction at negative bias is more prevalent with top-gate modulation than bottom-gate
modulation because the top gate modulates a smaller area of the channel than the bottom
gate, and thus the top-gate conﬁguration suﬀers from higher access resistance.

the diﬀerence in access resistance, the ﬁeld eﬀect mobility extracted from raw conductance
modulation data is superior in the top-gate conﬁguration.
There are a number of physical mechanisms that may lead to an improvement in transfer characteristics in a top-gated hole accumulation layer: a reduced density of charged
impurities at the top bP/POx interface as compared to the bP/SiO2 interface, stronger
screening of charged impurities due to the shorter electrical length of the top-gate versus
the bottom-gate, and a reduced contact and access resistance to the top accumulation layer
where the source-drain electrodes are deposited as compared with the bottom accumulation
layer. More subtle mechanisms, such as the role of phonon scattering at the respective
bP/dielectric interfaces could also play a role.
Lastly, we investigated bp FET channel modulation in a dual-gate mode, akin to the
velocity modulated transistor proposed by Sakaki23. The source-drain current IDS versus
top-gate voltage VT G at a variety of bottom-gate voltages VBG is plotted in Fig.
5(a).
Similarly, IDS versus bottom-gate voltage VBG at a variety of top-gate voltages VT G is
plotted in Fig. 5(b). Several eﬀects in the dual-gate mode are evident. Both the threshold
voltage and on-current for hole accumulation induced by one gate voltage is modulated
by the voltage applied to the other gate. The former eﬀect is a consequence of both gate
electrodes modulating the potential through-out the exfoliated bP ﬂake. The latter eﬀect
is a consequence of gate modulation of both contact resistance and channel mobility, as has
been previously observed in bP22. Notably, the peak top-gate ﬁeld eﬀect mobility can be
increased to µT G = 115 cm2V−1s−1 at a bottom-gate voltage VBG = −50 V.
The improvement in mobility of a hole accumulation layer at the bP/POx interface in
this work as compared to the bP/Al2O3 interface of previous work22 can be attributed to

the combined action of etching away the bP surface damaged by oxidation under ambient
conditions and the low defect density of the bP/POx interface formed by RIE18. The RIE
process etches away the bP surface exposed to ambient water and oxygen9, allowing a clean
bP/POx interface to be formed. The POx layer formed by RIE is itself an ideal seeding
layer for subsequent ALD steps to enable gate dielectric engineering. In contrast, ALD of
a top-gate dielectric such as Al2O3 directly atop bP is subject to the low quality of an
ambient exposed bP surface.
In summary, we have shown that the POx/Al2O3 layers produced by RIE and ALD
treatment of bP can be used as an eﬀective gate dielectric stack in bP FETs with on/oﬀ
current ratios > 300 and ﬁeld eﬀect mobilities of 115 cm2V−1s−1 at room temperature,
exceeding the performance on the SiO2 bottom-gate in the same bP FET channel. The
simple POx/Al2O3 process enables the fabrication of dual-gated FETs, which have seen
great interest in the context of the Stark eﬀect, where band structure is modulated by
applied electric ﬁeld28,29.
