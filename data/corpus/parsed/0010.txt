Virtual Sensor Based Fault Detection and  
Classification on a Plasma Etch Reactor 
 
Donald A. Sofge, NeuroDyne Inc. 
 
 
Abstract 
The SEMATECH sponsored J-88-E project teaming 
Texas Instruments with NeuroDyne (et al) focused 
on Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) on a 
Lam 9600 aluminum plasma etch reactor, used in the 
process 
of 
semiconductor 
fabrication. 
Fault 
classification was accomplished by implementing a 
series of virtual sensor models which used data from 
real sensors (Lam Station sensors, Optical Emission 
Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe 
setpoints and wafer state characteristics. Fault 
detection and classification were performed by 
comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values 
with expected values.  Models utilized include linear 
PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network PLS. 
Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data 
provides a capability for cross-checking that the 
machine is maintaining the desired setpoints.  Wafer 
state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction 
and Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using 
these same process sensors (Lam, OES, RFM). 
Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics 
in a production setting (where typically this 
information may be only sparsely available, if at all, 
after batch processing runs with numerous wafers 
have been completed) would provide important 
information to the operator that the process is or is 
not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of 
product quality.  Production yield is increased, and 
correspondingly per unit cost is reduced, by 
providing the operator with the opportunity to adjust 
the process or machine before etching more wafers. 
 
1.0 Background 
The ability to sense and adapt to varying material 
characteristics and process conditions over a large 
range of operating conditions is critical to the 
affordable, 
high 
volume 
manufacture 
of 
IC 
electronic devices.  In a flexible manufacturing 
environment this is highly dependent upon the 
accurate development and subsequent adaptation of 
models 
which 
simulate 
process, 
wafer, 
and 
equipment relationships and with feedback from insitu sensors are used to predict process trends and 
develop control strategies. Virtual sensor models are 
shown to be capable of predicting machine states and 
wafer state properties such as line width and oxide 
loss based upon process sensor data (machine state 
sensors, Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES), RF 
Monitoring (RFM)). Improvements in sensor based 
feedback and control that remove uncertainty in 
plasma etching will have a major impact in 
semiconductor manufacturing and integrated circuit 
fabrication. As plasma etch is a key step in many 
semiconductor fabrication processes, improvements 
in plasma etch using virtual sensor based models 
provide a crucial link to intelligent process 
monitoring and sensor-based control in the multibillion dollar semiconductor manufacturing industry. 
 
A key automation problem in the semiconductor 
manufacturing area is the efficient high-yield 
fabrication 
of 
semiconductor 
circuits. 
Plasma 
etching, a dry etching technique that usually follows 
the growth or deposition of thin films, is the key 
process by which desired circuits are patterned on a 
semiconductor wafer. As pattern geometries become 
more intricate in the submicron range, etching 
processes become more complex. In a typical 
etching process, a mixture of different halogencontaining gases are introduced in a vacuum etching 
chamber. The plasma is generated in the reactor by a 
high-frequency RF source. The desired goals of the 
etching 
process 
are 
controlling 
performance 
parameters such as the etch rate, the selectivity of 
etch for process endpoint control, the anisotropy for 
feature size control, and minimum defect generation. 
A number of process factors influence all of these 
parameters of interest: flow rate, power density of 
the RF source, pressure, chemistry, purity of the 
environment, 
substrate 
bias, 
and 
electrode 
configuration. Because the plasma process is highly 
nonlinear, controllability of the desired parameters is 
considered 
intractable. 
Typical 
semiconductor 
manufacturers use a trial and error procedure to 
realize a repeatable fabrication process that has 
acceptable yield. This is expensive in time and 
material. Better modelling, instrumentation and 
control techniques that remove this uncertainty in 
etching will have a major impact in semiconductor 
manufacturing and integrated circuit fabrication.

1.1 Plasma Etching  
While chemical or wet etching was the norm in 
previous generations of IC processing, it is limited to 
feature sizes of 1-2 mm and aspect ratios of the 
devices no better than 1:1. Since the state of the art 
of today's and the next generation high-density ICs 
will rely on submicron features as low as 0.1 mm, 
dry etching techniques based on plasma etching has 
become the dominant etching process. Plasma 
etching, such as those based on electron cyclotron 
resonant (ECR) sources and reactive ion etch (RIE), 
allow etching of fine lines and features without loss 
of definition. In this form of etching, a plasma, 
comprising ions, free radicals and neutral species, is 
formed above a masked surface by adding large 
energy doses to a gas at low pressures. This is 
commonly accomplished by electrical discharges in 
gases at milliTorr pressures generating high kinetic 
energy plasma that impinge on the non-masked 
portions of the semiconductor substrate. By using 
gases that react with the substrate, the etching can be 
made more effective. Typically, halogen-containing 
gases, such as CF4 and CHF3, are used together with 
other gases such as oxygen.  A horizontal parallel 
plate radial flow type plasma reactor that is used for 
plasma etching (or deposition by changing the 
chemistry) is shown in Figure 2.  
 
The etching process is described and specified by 
various parameters which may include: 
 
 
• Line Width 
 
• Oxide Loss 
 
• Etch rate 
 
• Selectivity: relative etch rate of different  
 
 materials 
 
• Anisotropy: ratio of vertical to horizontal  
 
 etch rates 
 
• Uniformity: refers to variations in etching rate  
 
 among runs, among wafers, or across a wafer 
 
•  Defect density on the wafer: these arise  
 
 due to particulate matter generated  
 
 during the etching process; expressed as  
 
 number of point  defects/cm2

1.2  Virtual Sensor Modelling 
Plasma etch processes in use today have been made 
reproducible by insuring that the process parameters 
are set according to a recipe.  The parameter settings 
are selected to provide a broad process window. The 
assumption has been if all of the process parameters 
that affect the process are set correctly, the process 
environment and the product produced will be 
reproducible.  Although substantial progress has 
been made using this approach, significant problems 
remain unresolved. Of particular importance is the 
need to be able to quickly detect a condition in the 
machine or the process environment that will have 
adverse effects on the product. 
 
The process model representation is shown in 
Figure 3.  The process or plasma etch chamber is 
shown in the center of the figure.  The function f 
maps from recipe setpoint parameters to chamber 
states, while the function g maps from the chamber 
states to wafer states.  Also shown is the inverse 
mapping f(-1), which is the virtual sensor mapping 
from the chamber state sensors back to recipe 
setpoints.  The functions f(-1) and g are implemented 
as virtual sensor models.

The use of sensor measurements for estimating 
setpoints and wafer states is based on the premise 
that the large number of signals from machine 
sensors, from optical emission spectroscopy (OES) 
sensors and from RFM sensors is rich in information 
about the "true" state of the plasma etch processing. 
If one can sort out the time series of hundreds of 
signals from these sensors and look at them in the 
appropriate way, it is possible to predict important 
information about the process and product quality. 
Wafer state characteristics which normally can only 
be measured by meticulous testing after processing 
is complete could be estimated routinely in real-time 
in a production environment, through use of Virtual 
Wafer State sensors.  Recipe setpoints could be 
verified even in the presence of sensor drift and 
possible sensor failure through use of virtual setpoint 
sensors.

Figure 4.  Multiple Virtual Sensors Provide Orthogonal Estimates 
of Process and Wafer States 
 
Furthermore, if the actual sensors providing the data 
to the virtual sensors are completely independent 
from one another (such as OES and RFM), then the 
use of multiple virtual sensors using orthogonal 
(independent) measurements could be used to 
provide redundant estimates of wafer states and 
setpoints as shown in Figure 4.  This use of 
redundancy would further insulate the process 
against sensor drift, and if virtual sensor estimates 
agree, would provide further support that the virtual 
sensor estimates are reliable indicators of true 
process and wafer states. 
 
2.0  Implementation 
The purpose of this program was to demonstrate 
advanced fault detection and classification for 
plasma etching on a Lam 9600 metal etcher. Process 
sensors including an Optical Emission Spectroscopy 
system and RF Monitoring sensors were added to 
monitor conditions in the plasma etch chamber. 
Computer interfaces for capturing the data and 
storing it to disk were created.  Virtual sensor 
models 
were 
implemented 
using 
multivariate 
statistical methods including PLS and PCR (and 
others described below), as well as techniques which 
combined neural networks with statistical methods. 
Fault 
classification 
was 
accomplished 
by 
implementing a series of virtual sensor models 
which use data from real sensors (such as Machine 
State, OES, and RFM) to predict recipe setpoints (f1) and wafer state characteristics (g).  Prediction of 
recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a 
capability for cross-checking that the machine is 
maintaining the desired setpoints, and may indicate 
sensor drift or failure if virtual sensors agree with 
one another but disagree with recipe setpoint values. 
Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width 
Reduction and Oxide Loss may be estimated on-line 
(g model) using these same process sensors 
(Machine, 
OES, 
RFM). 
 
Wafer-to-wafer 
measurement of these characteristics in a production 
setting (where typically this information may be only 
sparsely available, if at all, after batch processing 
runs with numerous wafers have been completed) 
would provide important information to the operator 
that the process is or is not producing wafers within 
acceptable bounds of product quality (e.g. LWR). If 
the g model virtual sensors, for example, reported a 
bad Oxide Loss after a given wafer had been 
processed, the operator would have the opportunity 
to adjust the process or machine before etching more 
wafers. 
 
2.1  Design Of Experiments (DOEs) 
Since one of the goals was to model the plasma etch 
process for a wide variety of process conditions and 
across a wide range of setpoints (rather than for just 
a single recipe), an experimental design was created 
to attempt to span the range of setpoints of interests. 
This resulted in two sets of wafer experiments, 
referred to as DOEs (design of experiments). 
 
The DOEs (Exp30 and Exp32) were based on a 5 
level central composite design centered around 
recipe 44, with 70 wafers in each DOE. Each of the 
DOEs spans 3 lots of wafers, or together they span 6 
lots.  Exp32 was designed to replicate Exp30 and 
provide temporal robustness to the models.  Of these 
70 wafers, 35 were designated for training the 
models, 23 for cross-validation, and 12 for testing. 
 
2.2  Data Pretreatment 
Raw sensor measurements from wafer processing are 
recorded every few seconds (exact sampling rates 
depend upon the specific sensor system), sometimes 
at irregular intervals, and generally the sampling of 
these signals is not coordinated with the sampling 
times for other sensors connected to the same 
machine.  Each of the sensors suites described 
provide dozens of raw sensor measurements at each 
sampling interval.  The time history of these signals 
from processing a single wafer provides the sensor 
data record of the etch.  Since the etch times for 
individual wafers vary, the length of these data 
records also varies.  Since these data records are 
quite voluminous and cumbersome to analyze in this 
format, for purposes of virtual sensor modelling in 
this effort it was decided to reduce the data through 
pretreatment.  Data pretreatment is covered in detail 
elsewhere in this report, so only the types of 
pretreatment used for building the f-1 and g models 
needs to be mentioned here.  OES data was first 
pretreated by reducing 2042 spectral lines into 40. 
Next, 
the 
time 
series 
records 
for 
sensor 
measurements were reduced a to set of vectors of 
signal metrics (means, std, etc.) for each wafer 
processed. This pretreament not only greatly 
simplified the modelling, but also enhanced model 
precision through precalculation of a number of 
important metrics which turned out to be very useful 
for prediction.

2.2.1  Data Separated by Etch Region 
One aspect of the TAS pretreatment is that it 
separates the sensor data by etch region (Figure 5).  
In a previous phase of this project we analyzed the 
predictive capability of virtual sensor models using 
data individually from one of the three main etch 
regions (Al, TiN, Ox), as well as the usefulness of 
combining the data from all etch regions.  It was 
found that there is great variation in the predictive 
capability of models by etch region (some 
parameters modelled better from TiN region data, 
some better with Ox region data).  In addition it was 
found that certain combinations of sensor type and 
etch region provided better data for certain models 
(e.g. OES based models using Ox region data 
provided the best f-1 models, while RFM based 
models benefited most from TiN region data for all 
predictions).  Combining sensor data from multiple 
etch regions, based on the premise that there might 
be a significant amount of complementary data 
present at different stages of the etch, yielded worse 
not better predictions.  From this result it was 
decided to focus in this phase of the project on use of 
data from etch regions individually (to not combine 
them).

2.3  Modelling Techniques Examined 
A wide variety of modelling techniques for 
implementation of the virtual sensor models were 
analyzed.  These included the following: 
 
•  Multidimensional Linear Regression (MLR) 
•  Principal Component Regression (PCR) 
•  Linear Partial Least Squares (PLS) 
•  Polynomial Regression 
•  Polynomial Partial Least Squares (PolyPLS) 
•  Neural Network Partial Least Squares (NNPLS) 
 
It was determined that MLR often failed on this type 
of data due to the collinearity of many of the signals 
(they are highly correlated), so this technique was 
abandoned. Polynomial regression was far less 
accurate in most cases than the other techniques 
tried, so this was dropped too. PCR and PLS 
generally yielded similar results (there are linear, 
polynomial, and neural network versions of PCR as 
well as for PLS), but PLS was generally slightly 
better than PCR.  Therefore for this stage of the 
project it was decided to focus only on the use of 
PLS techniques, considering only Linear PLS, 
Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network PLS models. 
 
In addition to verifying that wafer state parameters 
and process setpoints can in fact be modelled using 
process sensor data, we sought to determine which 
modelling techniques would be most suitable for this 
task, which etch region(s) provided the richest 
source(s) of information for prediction, how accurate 
and how robust would these models be.  It was 
decided that we would model the 7 recipe parameters 
included in the DOE (the f-1 models), and two wafer 
state parameters (LWR and Oxide Loss).  Models 
were developed separately for each sensor data set to 
achieve the redundancy described, and based upon 
data from individual etch regions. Furthermore, the 
question of which of the three PLS techniques 
(Linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network 
PLS) would provide the most robust, accurate 
models needed to be addressed. 
 
Of the three modelling techniques used (linear, 
polynomial, and neural network based PLS), the 
least accurate and least robust of these techniques 
was clearly polynomial PLS.  The best models for a 
given sensor and etch region generally came from 
either neural network based PLS or linear PLS, with 
the neural network based PLS often edging out the 
linear PLS in terms of prediction accuracy.  Often, 
however, for the same training and prediction data, 
the difference between these two models was slight. 
More 
importantly, 
however, 
the 
linear 
PLS 
technique proved to be more robust.  While the 
neural network based PLS often gave the highest 
prediction accuracy, it sometimes also gave the 
worst (on data from a different etch region/sensor 
combination). Due to this somewhat unpredictable 
behavior on the part of neural network based PLS, 
and the marginal advantage it offered in terms of 
prediction accuracy, it was decided to focus on the 
analysis of linear PLS results for the remainder of 
the effort.

3.0 Modelling Results 
 
3.1  f-1 Model Results, Sensor Measurements to 
Setpoints  
The purpose of the f-1 virtual sensor model is to use 
process state sensor to predict recipe setpoint values.  
This is to provide a way of cross-checking the 
effective setpoint parameters according to plasma 
chamber dynamics with the desired setpoints as 
specified by the current recipe.  If there is a 
mismatch between what the setpoints are and what 
the f-1 virtual sensor models are predicting, then it is 
possible that the process has drifted from setpoint 
and needs to be corrected.  It can also indicate that 
the sensors and/or actuators regulating setpoints may 
be in error due to miscalibration, drift or 
malfunction. 
 
The recipe parameters modelled for f-1 were: 
 
•  Pressure (mTorr) 
•  Top Power (watts) 
•  Rfbot (watts) 
•  BCl3 (sccm) 
•  Cl2 (sccm) 
•  Cl2/BCl3   
•  Total Flow (sccm)

As shown in Figures 6 and 7, it was possible to get 
fairly accurate predictive models for the power 
parameters, by carefully selecting sensor type and 
etch region which resulted in the best model(s). Note 
that these are pure predictions based on data which 
were not included in model building.  It should be 
noted that there were many models passed over 
because they did not perform so well.  There 
appeared to be little consistency from one DOE to 
the next on which etch regions and which sensors 
would result in the best models, though some areas 
and sensors did appear to give consistently poor 
results. 
 
As shown in Figure 8, the best models gave fairly 
accurate results (usually less than 5%) for predicting 
the RF parameters, and significantly poorer results 
(20-30% 
error) 
in 
predicting 
the

parameters.

3.2  Model g Results, 
Sensor Measurements to Wafer States 
 
3.2.1  Line Width Reduction (LWR) 
Analysis of Electrical LWR data clearly indicated 
that there was a significant variation of LWR based 
upon position on the wafer.  Electrical line width 
measurements were taken post-etch for the 32 die 
positions on each wafer.  Since there are no die 
location specific variables in the process sensors 
(although there is some OES sensor sensitivity to 
stripes of die locations, depending upon the 
orientations of the OES fiber optic sensors), it was 
necessary to build a separate PLS model for each die 
position.  (This is functionally the equivalent of 
having a multiple Y-block PLS model which has a 
separate prediction for each die). 
 
No pre-etch measurements were taken, so all LWR 
measurements were based upon an assumed 
incoming line width of 0.5 microns.  In fact it was 
later found that there was a significant variation of 
incoming line width (described elsewhere in this 
report) of about 0.02 microns.  Given this limitation 
in the accuracy of the post-etch LWR data ((0.5 - 

===== Page 6 =====

 
6 
measurement) +/-0.02 microns), then we could only 
expect to model LWR to about 0.02 microns.   
 
Comparison of results from using Neural Network 
based PLS models to Linear PLS models illustrates a 
common result found in this study: that while the 
NNPLS models may have the lowest average 
prediction error (NNPLS OES Ox models have the 
highest prediction accuracy), the NNPLS technique 
may also result in some of the worst models 
(NNPLS RFM Al models).  The Linear PLS models 
are almost as accurate as the NNPLS models, but 
don't seem to result in really poor models as often. 
 
This point is made clearer by looking at the 
prediction accuracies of the individual die models 
for LWR.  As shown in Figure 9, there is a clear 
dependence on model accuracy and die position 
(which may be an indication of LWR reproducibility 
at different locations on a wafer).  It is also obvious 
that the NNPLS models are more accurate than the 
Linear PLS models.

3.2.2 Oxide Loss 
As with LWR measurements, there were 32 oxide 
loss measurements taken per wafer, with a 
dependence of oxide loss measurement upon die 
position, so it was necessary to generate a separate 
model for each die position. Looking at the oxide 
loss predictions from this sensor and etch region for 
Die #32 (Figure 10), we can see that the model was 
able to track oxide loss pretty well.  Note in 
particular the large deviation in wafer #8 (for the die 
#32 position) of the test set. The Linear PLS model 
was quite successful in predicting this deviation 
strictly based upon the machine state data. 
 
Since there was no "nominal" oxide loss available 
for these DOE data, we calculated the average oxide 
loss across all dies across all wafers.  Note that this 
average doesn't represent a normal or expected 
value, since the DOEs spanned a wide range of 
recipes and processing conditions, but merely 
represent a statistical mean. It was found that we 
could predict oxide loss from each of the process 
sensors using Linear PLS models to within about 67% of the range of the training data.

4.0  Conclusions 
Accurate predictions of Wafer State Characteristics 
and Recipe Parameters can be achieved using virtual 
sensor models with Machine State, OES, and RFM 
Sensor Data.  Each of these sensors provides 
sufficient information for accurate predictions. No 
one sensor is consistently better than the others.  Use 
of multiple redundant virtual sensors for each 
quantity being sensed is necessary, since predictions 
from a given sensor and etch region may not be 
consistently reliable. Virtual sensor models are made 
robust by including in their training sets sensor data 
which spans multiple lots over an extended period of 
time.  Models built upon data from a single lot of 
wafers processed at a particular point in time are not 
likely to be valid outside of that lot and point in 
time. 
 
Three PLS modelling techniques were investigated 
in this effort: Linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and 
Neural Network PLS (NNPLS).  NNPLS and Linear 
PLS provided the best results (minimum rms 
prediction error).  Although NNPLS often provides 
slightly better models than Linear PLS, NNPLS also 
produces the worst models in many cases.  If only 
one modelling technique were to be used, we would 
recommend that it be Linear PLS.  Linear PLS 
generally provides models comparable to the best 
NNPLS models (if sometimes slightly less accurate), 
while resulting in fewer really poor models than the 
other techniques tried.

5.0  Future Research 
Accurate predictions of wafer state characteristics 
and recipe parameters can be achieved using virtual 
sensor models with machine state, optical emission 
spectroscopy (OES), and RF monitoring (RFM) 
sensor data.  In many cases each of these sensors 
provide 
sufficient 
information 
for 
accurate 
predictions. However, significant levels of noise still 
exist in many of the sensor signals which corrupt 
models, and many of the sensor signals are highly 
correlated. Our results have suggested that by 
selectively reducing the number of variables used for 
modelling, we can improve the overall robustness of 
our models and get consistently better predictions. 
By separating over a thousand different variables 
(108 machine state variables, 504 OES variables, 
and 560 RFM variables) according to etch region, 
we found that we were able to improve the accuracy 
of our predictive models.  Also, contrary to intuition, 
combining or fusing sensor data from two or more 
sensors into a single model generally resulted in 
worse, not better, models.  An analysis of the 
variables suggests that significant noise exists in 
many of the sensor streams, and that the addition of 
more sensor data has the potential to corrupt models 
rather than improve them.  Also, it was found 
through multivariate statistical analysis that many of 
these variables (for all three sensor systems 
mentioned) were highly correlated. 
 
This suggests that models may be made more 
accurate and much more robust if we can 
intelligently select which combinations of variables 
from the sensor data which will result in the best 
models, while eliminating those which will corrupt 
the models. Variable selection is needed into order to 
select a set or subset of sensor lines which contribute 
to models with the best predictive accuracy and 
robustness. Since there are literally hundreds of 
variables to comb through, we propose using Genetic 
Algorithms to select variables, build and test models, 
and to evolve a set of variables which yield models 
with better predictive capabilities and which are 
consistently more accurate.
