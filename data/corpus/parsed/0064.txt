Uniform, defect-free crystal interfaces and surfaces are crucial ingredients for realizing highperformance nanoscale devices. A pertinent example is that advances in gate-tunable and topological
superconductivity using semiconductor/superconductor electronic devices are currently built on the
hard proximity-induced superconducting gap obtained from epitaxial indium arsenide/aluminium
heterostructures. Fabrication of devices requires selective etch processes; these exist only for InAs/Al
hybrids, precluding the use of other, potentially superior material combinations. We present a crystal growth platform – based on three-dimensional structuring of growth substrates – which enables
synthesis of semiconductor nanowire hybrids with in-situ patterned superconductor shells. This
platform eliminates the need for etching, thereby enabling full freedom in choice of hybrid constituents. We realise and characterise all the most frequently used architectures in superconducting
hybrid devices, ﬁnding increased yield and electrostatic stability compared to etched devices, along
with evidence of ballistic superconductivity. In addition to aluminium, we present hybrid devices
based on tantalum, niobium and vanadium.

have attracted considerable attention from the condensed matter community since the prediction1,2 and
observation3–5 of Majorana zero-modes,
which have
been proposed as a basis for topologically protected
quantum information processors.6,7 To ensure topological protection, methods for growing disorder-free
‘hard-gap’ SE/SU epitaxial hybrids were developed.8–10
These materials use bottom-up crystal growth of InAs
NWs with uniform epitaxial aluminium coatings, an
approach which has been extended to high mobility
two-dimensional systems11,12 and selective area grown
networks.13,14 The success of epitaxial InAs/Al hybrids
lies in the ability to selectively remove the Al via

Majorana islands.21–23 A limitation of this method is
that the need for post-process etching inherently limits
materials choice. For instance, despite strong incentives
to utilise technologically important superconductors
such as Nb24 and NbTiN25 – which exhibit higher
transition temperatures, critical magnetic ﬁelds and
superconducting energy gaps – selectively removing Nb
from InAs remains an unsolved problem.
Similarly,
while InSb is an attractive semiconductor due to its high
mobility, g-factor and strong spin-orbit coupling,25–28
there is no reported method for selectively removing
even Al from InSb without damage.
Thus, most potential improvements in epitaxial SE/SU technology
are predicated on developing a materials-independent
method for device fabrication. An attractive approach
to eliminating etch processes is to employ an in-situ
‘shadow approach’ that masks speciﬁc segments along
the NW from superconductor growth.
Initial progress
was demonstrated in Refs. 29,30 where deterministically
positioned NWs were shadowed by adjacent NWs. This
approach, however, requires accurate control of relative
NW positions and growth directions. Further, the range
of the possible device geometries is limited, since the
NWs create only narrow gaps in the SU coating.
Here, we demonstrate a ﬂexible platform for growing device-ready hybrids in numerous geometries.
We
combine pre-growth fabrication of shadow structures directly on NW growth substrates with precise positioning
of NW growth sites and full in-situ control of the orientation of superconductor ﬂux.
The shadow epitaxy
platform enables independent materials choice (SU,SE)
and we demonstrate simultaneous growth of the most
important hybrid device architectures using aluminium,
niobium, tantalum and vanadium.31 Eliminating postprocess chemical etching increased spectroscopic device
yield (5 out of 5 for Al and Ta devices), enabled ballistic
superconductivity in Nb devices, and enhanced electrostatic stability by an order of magnitude in Majorana island devices. Very high yield and large-range, hysteresisfree device operation are crucial metrics for future advanced circuitry that incorporates a large number of hyarXiv:1911.00460v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  8 May 2020

brid elements. Finally, we show that the platform is compatible with both half-shell and full-shell hybrid geometries and allows for functional devices to be encapsulated
in-situ with passivating dielectrics, thus protecting sensitive elements. While the focus here is on semiconductor/superconductor hybrids, shadow epitaxy is equally
applicable for any metal/semiconductor/insulator combination, extending the scope to other applications where
pristine surfaces and interfaces are key.32,33
THE SHADOW EPITAXY PLATFORM
Figure 1 illustrates the platform features. A (111)Boriented InAs growth substrate is patterned with etched
trenches and a series of silicon oxide (SiOx) ‘bridges’.
NWs are grown from gold catalyst particles,
prepositioned at the trench bottom with the desired lateral distance from the overhanging bridge(s). NWs are
grown by molecular beam epitaxy8 and the bridges act as
shadow masks for subsequent in-situ deposition of superconductors, normal metals, or dielectrics. The material is
deposited from a direction parallel to the trenches and inclined by an angle θ = 5−45◦from the substrate surface.

b, Tantalum (middle panel 20 nm thick; right panel 5 nm

SU shadow edge was determined by the geometry of the mask
and chamber, as well as material diﬀusion (Supplementary
Section 2). Ta and Nb had typical lt ∼65 −120 nm and Al
lt ≤60 nm. The broad bright/dark fringes in low-resoultion
TEM (middle panels) are likely bending contours, whereby
slight bends in the NW result in modulation of the crystal
plane orientation with respect to the beam. Scale bars represent 500 nm (left images), 100 nm (middle images) and 1 nm
(right images).
The situation is schematically shown in Figure 1b,c. The
bridge design is thereby projected as a pattern in the
superconducting layer on each NW, eﬀectively growing
the desired device architecture, with independent choice
of SE and SU material. For process details see Methods
and Supplementary Section 1.
To ensure a pristine interface, the sample remains
under ultra-high vacuum (< 10−8 Torr) between NW
growth and superconductor deposition.8,10,11,24,31
In
the simplest, single-deposition case, the superconductor
coats 2 or 3 of the NW’s 6 facets – i.e.
a half-shell
coating – except for regions shadowed by the bridge.
This breaks the NW into a sequence of SU segments
separated by bare SE. The length and number of segments are controlled by θ and the projected bridge design (Supplementary Section 2). Additional possibilities
using multiple depositions, angles and/or materials are
demonstrated below (Figure 5). Figure 1e-g show scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of bridges designed to
produce the four most important hybrid device geometries. Half-shadowed NWs (Figure 1d) are the canonical design for tunnel-spectroscopy characterisation of the
(sub)gap properties of hybrids,3,5,9,28 and are obtained by
shadowing the entire lower section of the NW with a wide
bridge.
A single, narrow bridge (Figure 1e) produces
a gate-tunable Josephson junction,34 the component at
the heart of gatemon and Andreev qubits.15–20 Double
and triple bridges (Figure 1f,g) produce hybrids with
single21,35,36 and double22 Majorana island geometries,
respectively, which are the building blocks of topological quantum computation schemes.7,37 In summary, the
shadow epitaxy platform enables materials-independent,
wafer-scale, parallel synthesis of device-ready hybrids, in
many diﬀerent geometries.
PATTERNING AND STRUCTURAL
CHARACTERISATION OF SU FILMS
The SU and SE feature sizes are largely deﬁned by the
shadow epitaxy mask used, although evaporation chamber geometry and material diﬀusion8 become important
when high precision is required. In particular, the ﬁnite
evaporation source size and the distances between NW,
mask and source generate ‘tail regions’ between fully covered and fully shadowed segments (Supplementary Section 2). The expected tail length is lt = 100 −200 nm
for our mask/chamber dimensions. To characterise this,
Figure 2 shows SEM and transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) of InAs hybrids with Al, Ta and
Nb shells.
Depositions were performed using e-beam
evaporation at room temperature except for Al, where
T ∼−150◦C (see Methods), with thicknesses tAl = 8 nm,
tNb = 40 nm, tTa = 20 nm (left and middle panel) and
tTa = 5 nm (right panel). Figure 2 middle panels show
typical lt = 65 −120 nm for Nb/Ta and lt < 60 nm
for Al. The smaller-than-estimated lt suggests that material diﬀusion acts to shorten lt. The enhanced diﬀusion and associated shorter lt for Al is expected from the
lower heat of vaporisation; ∆HAl

∼700 kJ/mol.8,31 Note that these eﬀects can
be compensated for by, e.g., altering mask design and
NW position, using a smaller deposition source or collimator, and/or double-angle evaporation (Supplementary
Section 2).

ties crucially inﬂuence the quality of the induced superconducting gap8,9 and the rightmost panels in Figure 2
show high resolution TEM of each interface. All interfaces were uniform, with clear semiconductor termination
and no interface oxides/contamination. Al and InAs exhibited an epitaxial relation, with the Al growing with
⟨111⟩out-of-plane orientation. This conﬁrms that shadowed interfaces and e-beam deposited Al retain the high
quality and structure of MBE-grown hybrids.8,24 The
Ta and Nb ﬁlms were amorphous/nanocrystalline with
a columnar morphology related the deposition angle, as
previously observed for Nb24 (Supplementary Section 3).
Reliable characterisation of nanocrystalline/amorphous
ﬁlms is challenging due to overlapping signals from randomly oriented grains.
However, by imaging a thin
(5 nm) Ta ﬁlm, randomly oriented grains with diameter
2−5 nm can be resolved. An amorphous/nanocrystalline
structure was found for Nb depositions both with substrate temperature T ∼−150◦C and at room temperature.
TUNNEL SPECTROSCOPY DEVICES
Low temperature transport experiments were performed both to benchmark the shadow-patterned hybrids against the wide literature on etched epitaxial
Al5,8–10,14,21,22,35,36,38 – performance gains are expected
due to eliminating post-process etching (Supplementary
Section 4) – and to characterise the new Ta and Nbbased hybrids.
Figure 3 displays results of tunnelspectroscopy measurements utilising half-shadowed hybrids (Figure 1d).
The exposed SE segment was contacted by a normal metal (Ti/Au) and electrostatic
gates were used to induce a quantum dot (QD) or
quantum point contact (QPC) tunnel barrier between
the Ti/Au and proximitised region.3,5,9,11,39 The differential conductance, G = dI/dVsd, in the tunneling
regime is proportional to the hybrid density of states,
as shown in Figure 3b for Al/InAs. A hard superconducting gap is seen for all Vg with coherence peaks at
Vsd = ±∆/e = ±0.25 mV, highlighted by the line trace
at Vg = −9.195 V. The gap hardness GN/GS (where
GS = G(Vsd = 0 mV) and GN is the out-of-gap conduc-

tance G(Vsd = −0.4 mV)) was ∼75 throughout the studied Vg range, with a peak value of 350 (Supplementary
Section 5). This is the highest reported ﬁgure in a SE/SU
hybrid, conﬁrming the high quality of the interface. Figure 3c shows the evolution in parallel magnetic ﬁeld, B∥,
with Vg ﬁxed at the position of the line trace of Figure 3b.
The gap closes at critical ﬁeld BC ∼2 T; consistent with
the thin (8 nm), ﬂat, epitaxial ﬁlm.5 Coalescing bound
states that stick to zero energy for B∥> 1.3 T were
also observed – highlighted by the line trace taken with
B∥= 1.5 T – resembling previously reported topological
zero modes.3,5 While a detailed analysis of zero-modes
is outside the scope of this article, the magnetic ﬁeldcompatibility and eﬀective g-factor = 6.538 highlight the
potential of the shadow hybrids for studying the topological regime.
In total, we fabricated ﬁve Al/InAs tunnel devices,
A1-A5, and logarithmic line traces of normalised conductance G/GN vs Vsd at ﬁxed Vg are shown in Figure 3d. All
ﬁve devices exhibited similar behaviour and a hard superconducting gap, with GN/GS = 50−100. Devices A2-A4
feature multiple peaks below the coherence peaks at ∆
due to bound states (Supplementary Section 6). Overall,
the results conﬁrm the high quality of the Al/InAs hybrids synthesised using shadow epitaxy, and the device
yield (5 out of 5) compares favourably with conventional
device processing using wet etching (Supplementary Section 4).
Turning to devices grown with Ta and Nb, all ﬁve
Ta/InAs devices exhibited induced superconductivity
(Fig 3e).
Devices T1-T4 showed hard gaps with values GN/GS = 50–100, persisting over a wide Vg range
(Supplementary Section 6), similar to Al/InAs hybrids.
T5 showed a lower hardness GN/GS ∼
10. Since the
Ta is nanocrystalline/amorphous (Figure 2b) these results show that the atomic ordering of epitaxial interfaces is not a prerequisite for hard gap superconductivity.
Rather, an impurity-free, uniform interface is
suﬃcient. The values for ∆Ta = 0.13 meV and corresponding T Ta

= 0.7 K are consistent with bulk ﬁlms of
matching thickness, 20 nm (Supplementary Section 7).40

The

of

and high critical magnetic ﬁelds – has motivated efforts to incorporate them in ex-situ-fabricated hybrid
nano-devices.3,12,25,26,41 Shadow epitaxy enables in-situ
Nb/InAs devices previously impossible due to lack of
selective process techniques.
Figures 3f,g present lowtemperature spectroscopic results. Upon increasing Vg,
the conductance for Vsd = 0.5 mV > ∆increases in steps
of 0.7 × 2e2/h and shows a doubling at the plateaus for
Vsd = 0. This is consistent with a near ballistic junction
and near perfect transmission at the contacts.11,26,27,42 In
the tunnelling regime, Vg ≤−12.5 V, conductance suppression is clearly observed for eVsd < |∆| ∼0.2 meV in
Figure 3g, albeit with relatively low hardness (GN/GS ∼
3).
Considering the near ballistic device characteristic
and high contact transmission, and given the excellent
gap hardness achieved in Al/InAs and Ta/InAs shadow
devices, it is unlikely the soft superconducting gap for
our in-situ Nb/InAs hybrid was caused by contaminated
or process-damaged interfaces. Rather, native oxides at
the Nb surface could provide an explanation. Nb oxides
can be superconducting with lower TC ∼2 K, metallic,
or magnetic43,44; each of these eﬀects leads to soft-gap
superconductivity in thin niobium ﬁlms. Using in-situ
surface passivation of Nb hybrids would likely provide
insights into how the surface impacts gap properties (see
Figure 5a). To summarise, the main result of Figure 3
is the demonstration of high-quality hybrid devices with
expanded choice of SU and SE.
STABILITY OF IN-SITU MAJORANA ISLAND
DEVICES
While tunnel spectroscopy devices are the essential
tool for characterising induced superconductivity, the elemental building block in most topological quantum computing architectures are ‘Majorana islands’,7,37 which
consist of a ﬁnite length hybrid segment retaining a
charging energy EC.
Single21 and double22 island geometries with arbitrary superconductors are realised using a shadow epitaxy pattern of two or three bridges
as shown in Figure 1f,g. The bridge separation(s) and
widths determine the lengths of the hybrid segment(s)
(∝EC) and the exposed NW segments, respectively.
Figure 4a shows a typical Al-based shadow-patterned
device, measured to enable comparison with conventional
etched devices. The gate potentials Vg and Vsg1,sg2 control the charge on the island and the tunnel coupling
to the Ti/Au leads.21,23,35,36 For EC < ∆and in the
absence of quasi-particles or sub-gap states, charge is
added in units of 2e (Cooper pairs). Figure 4b, shows
G vs. Vsd and Vg exhibits 2e-periodic Coulomb diamonds
that correspond to a charging energy 2EC ∼130 µeV
(dashed lines). Quasi-particle 1e periodic charging is seen
for |eVsd| > ∆∼180 µeV (solid lines).21,35 Figure 4c
shows the temperature dependence of the low-bias Vginduced charging. The 2e periodic state persists up to
T ∼250 −300 mK, where a transition to 1e periodicity
occurs due to thermal excitation of quasi-particles. This
temperature is set by ∆and the volume of the superconductor and is comparable to that observed in etched
devices.14,23,35
A reproducible and quiet electrostatic platform is crucial for charge-based topological devices, since environmental charge ﬂuctuations and noise couple both to the
island charge and tunnel couplings through the semiconductor, and thereby constitute a direct source of qubit
decoherence.45,46 Furthermore, with increasing complex-

ity of topological Majorana circuits, ﬁne-tuning in a
multi-dimensional space of cross-coupled parameters is
required, and stability and reproducibility become important requirements.
In conventional etched devices,
the stable operation range is typically limited to ≲20
consecutive charge states,14,21,23,35,36 as uncontrolled discrete charging of nearby impurity sites leads to random
switches of the island charge/parity. The shadow device
exhibits an increase of this range by at least an order
of magnitude, consistent with a cleaner electrostatic environment due to the obviation of processing.
This is
demonstrated in Figure 4d, which shows the stable evolution of 182(364) consecutive 2e(1e) charge states accessed by continuously sweeping Vg, and an interleaved,
step-wise increase of B∥. The island is superconducting
in this ﬁeld range, and the bifurcation of the spectrum
at B∥∼200 mT is caused by the appearance of a bound
state below the gap, as previously analysed.14,21,36 In ad-

dition to a topological transition, various trivial eﬀects
can lead to a 2e −1e-transition in B∥, each exhibiting
distinct peak spacing and amplitude modulation.14,21,36
For example, the zooms of three regions of panel Figure 4d, shown in Figures 4e-g, exhibit strikingly diﬀerent behaviors. Figure 4e features 1e-spacings independent of B∥, in Figure 4f the peaks spacing and amplitude
are modulated by B∥,47 while a 2e-2e transition occurs
with a parity change in the range of Figure 4h.36 The behaviour shown in Figure 4f is consistent with a topological transition;14,21,22,36,47,48 however, a detailed study is
outside the scope of this work and will be presented elsewhere. The important point here is that the shadow platform greatly enhances the range of hysteresis-free, stable
device operation, which in turn facilitates the simultaneous study of diﬀerent behaviours. Measuring over this
larger, stable range provides new information, including
the identiﬁcation of slowly varying features such as the
Vg-dependence of the 2e-1e transitions, which may be
linked to gate-dependent g-factor of the bound state38 or
related to weakly coupled bound-states localised in the
leads.39 The potential for increased understanding of device features and large range stability may thus enable
reliable and rapid identiﬁcation of the topological regime.
In addition, stable and non-hysteretic navigation in parameter space is a prerequisite for employing automatic
tuning and operation procedures that will be essential for
operation of complex quantum devices in the future.49
Just as the Majorana island is the basic component for topological architectures, gate-tunable Josephson junctions (JJs) constitute the elementary component
of superconducting ‘gatemon’19,20 and Andreev qubit
devices.15–18 Electrostatic stability is also critical here
for qubit decoherence and tuning.20 In-situ JJ devices
are grown using single-bridge shadows (Figure 1e), and
low-temperature characterisation is presented in Supplementary Section 8, demonstrating quiet operation and
gate-tunable critical currents ∼10 nA, consistent with
previous devices.15,16,19
ADVANCED ARCHITECTURES
Having demonstrated the use of shadow epitaxy to realise the most important hybrid device geometries, we
now discuss further extensions and the ﬂexibility of the
method. Firstly, Figure 5a illustrates how steep-angle
depositions under rotation enable in-situ conformal dielectric coatings that protect sensitive interfaces, contacts, and surfaces during subsequent device processing. A second extension, illustrated in Figure 5b, employs consecutive shadow depositions from diﬀerent angles to realise a complete in-situ junction with nonidentical contact elements. Such double-angle-generated
structures thus produce both lateral and axial hybrid devices incorporating, e.g., normal metal, superconducting
and/or magnetic elements with pristine epitaxial interfaces.
Double-angle deposition also enables JJ devices
with arbitrarily short junction length, as demonstrated
in Figure 5c for a vanadium based hybrid31 made by two
depositions from diﬀerent angles θ1 = 16◦, θ2 = 17◦.
Conveniently, the semiconductor segment length lSE depends not only the angles θ1 and θ2, but also the separation S between bridge and NW. Increasing S from 9 µm
to 17 µm reduced lSE from ∼400 nm to ∼40 nm.
An important feature of our shadow epitaxy platform
is the straightforward generalisation to full-shell geometries, achieved by radially copying the bridge design and
depositing the coating from corresponding angles around
the NW. Figure 5d shows an example full-shell JJ,48
and the other geometries from Figure 1 can be implemented following the same strategy. Deposition of different materials from the various directions further in-

creases the possible functionality. Shadow epitaxy also
applies to planar structures such as selective area grown
nanostructures13,14,50 or vapour-liquid-solid NWs grown
parallel to the substrate29 (Supplementary Section 9).
Finally, we discuss the potential for large scale fabrication using vertical device structures in Supplementary
Section 10.
CONCLUSION
In-situ-grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid
devices form the backbone of electronic implementations
of quantum information ranging from topological qubits,
gatable transmon devices and Andreev quantum dots.
The shadow epitaxy platform transcends previous restrictions on the possible material combinations, and obviates the most potentially damaging fabrication steps,
thus providing clear enhancement of device quality and
functionality. Beyond these applications, electrical contact quality, reproducibility and surface disorder play an
pivotal role in nearly all nanoscale devices32,33 and thus
improving material quality via shadow epitaxy holds the
potential to strongly impact also conventional electronics, sensor-applications and optoelectronic devices.32,33
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Fabrication of the shadow epitaxy platform.
The platform is based on InAs (111)B-oriented substrates, capped with a 100 −150 nm thick SiOx layer
grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.
The fabrication procedure is illustrated schematically in
Supplementary Figure 1. The bridges were formed by two
sequential wet etching steps using a single photolithographically deﬁned resist mask (photoresist AZ1505),
with the custom pattern exposed using a Heidelberg
µPG501 LED writer. Etching the SiOx using buﬀered
hydroﬂouric acid (6% in H2O at room temperature)
leaves strips of oxide in the desired bridge pattern, with
typical length L
∼
10 µm and widths in the range
W = 400 nm – 2 µm. The resist was removed and the
InAs was subsequently etched using a 37:23:12 solution
of C6H8O7(40%):H3PO4(80%):H2O2 with the SiOx pattern acting as an etch mask. The anisotropic etch preferentially exposes (111)B InAs crystal planes and thereby
forms trenches in the substrate, with a (111)B surface at
the trench bottom suitable for NW growth. An etch time
of 5 mins at room temperature produced trences with
depth D ∼7 µm. The InAs etchant under-etches material from both sides of each SiOx strip and a void forms
underneath the strips since their width W ≪D. The
result is SiOx bridges suspended above the etched InAs
surface (Figure 1a). The process is highly reproducible
and robust on a wafer scale (Supplementary Figure 2).
The potential to use the platform with antimonide, nitride, silicon, and other NW materials is discussed in
Supplementary Section 1.
Electron beam lithography
(PMMA A4.5 and EL13 resist stack) and e-beam deposition of Au were used to deﬁne the catalyst particles for
NW growth. The platform is naturally compatible with
multiple catalyst particles per bridge, and methods for
randomly deﬁning catalyst position. Note that fabricating the bridges requires merely a single photolithography
step; the complex structures are obtained via relatively
simple processing.
Nanowire hybrid growth. InAs NWs were grown
via the Au catalyst-assisted vapour-liquid-solid mechanism in a solid-source Varian GEN-II MBE system following a two-step protocol. In the ﬁrst step, NWs were
grown vertically along the (111)B direction, using As4
cracker temperature 500◦C, substrate thermocouple temperature of 447◦C and V/III ﬂux ratio ∼10. A growth
time of 80 mins resulted in 5 −8 µm-long NWs. The
second step involved growth at reduced substrate thermocouple temperature (350◦C) and increased As cracker
temperature (800◦C) for 10 mins. These conditions promote radial overgrowth and ﬂatter NW facets, optimal
for subsequent superconductor deposition.
After InAs growth, the substrate was transferred under ultra-high vacuum to a metal evaporation chamber,
with a freely rotatable sample holder that can be cooled
to a thermocouple temperature of approx. −150◦C using
liquid nitrogen. The low temperature is used to decrease
the size and pitch between the initial critical clusters,
which promotes a continuous and ﬂat ﬁlm morphology.8
It also suppresses the potential for parasitic material to
settle outside the shadow-mask deﬁned regions, which
may occur in particular for Al depositions at higher temperatures. The superconductor layers (Al, Ta, Nb, V)
were deposited using e-beam evaporation at a ﬁxed angle to align with the shadow mask design. The NWs grow
with type-I, {1100} facets and the shadow mask design
is oriented such that the superconductor deposition coats
either 2 or 3 of the NW facets, as desired.
Electron microscopy. SEM characterisation of the
substrates, as-grown NWs and ﬁnished devices was carried out in a JEOL 7800F using acceleration voltage
Vacc = 5 −10 kV. For TEM characterisation, NWs
were transferred from the growth substrate to a carbon
membrane grid using a micromanipulator under an optical microscope. TEM micrographs were obtained using either a Philips CM20 (Figure 2, center panels) with
Vacc = 200 kV, a FEI Titan Analytical 80-300ST featuring a monochromator and Vacc = 300 kV (Figure 2a,
right panel) or a Phillips 3000F with Vacc = 300 kV (Figures. 2b,c, right panels). NWs were oriented with the
beam parallel to an InAs facet (⟨2¯1¯10⟩zone-axis).
Device fabrication and measurement. NWs were
transferred from the growth substrate to pre-patterned
device substrates using a micromanipulator under an optical microscope.
Ti/Au contacts and side gates were
deﬁned simultaneously using electron beam lithography
and e-beam deposition.
Ar+-ion milling was used immediately prior to contact deposition to remove native

InAs oxide and ensure ohmic contact to the NW. Electron transport measurements were conducted in an Oxford Triton dilution refrigerator with a base temperature
∼20 mK and a 6-1-1 T vector magnet. Standard low
frequency (∼200 Hz) lock-in techniques were used to
measure diﬀerential conductance. For the island device
in Figure 4, the cross-coupling of Vg to the tunnel barrier segments was compensated by sweeping Vsg1,sg2 simultaneously with Vg using experimentally determined
proportionality factors.
Note the small oﬀsets in Figures 4d-g between measurements at successive Vg vanish when measuring within a smaller gate range, as in
Figures 4b,c.
