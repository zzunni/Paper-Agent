Abstract 
Colloidal lithography has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional nanofabrication 
techniques, offering the ability to create nanoscale patterns in a cost-effective and scalable 
manner. However, it has been so far limited by defects such as empty areas or multilayered 
regions, hindering its application. We introduce a novel "ice-assisted transfer" technique that 
combines  rubbing-based particle assembly on elastomer substrates with ice-mediated transfer 
to achieve defect-free, high-quality polycrystalline particle monolayers. This approach 
eliminates foreign material contamination and enables precise control of particle arrangement 
and density. By optimizing process parameters, including surfactant concentration and water film 
thickness, we minimized defects and demonstrated the versatility of this method in fabricating 
functional nanoscale structures. We highlighted the benefits of this process through two 
applications: (1) antireflective "moth-eye" coatings, which achieved near-zero reflection in the 
mid-infrared spectrum due to improved particle monolayer quality; and (2) nanostructured 
surfaces for ligand-free T-cell activation, whose topography enhanced cell activation, 
showcasing potential for immunotherapy applications. The process achieves rapid, cost-efficient 
patterning without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for diverse fields requiring 
scalable nanostructuring. This work represents a significant advancement in colloidal 
lithography, addressing critical challenges and unlocking its potential for practical applications 
in optics, biotechnology, and beyond. 
Over the last two decades, colloidal lithography has been recognized as an attractive alternative 
to traditional bottom-up nanofabrication methods due to its ability to produce quasiperiodic 
nanoscale patterns in a simple, low-cost manner, without the need for sophisticated 
equipment1,2. This assembly  can be performed using various self-assembly approaches3,4, such 
as dip-coating5, spin-coating6, solvent evaporation7, and Langmuir-Blodgett based assembly8, 
and broadly applied in engineering of nanoscale devices in systems in various areas including but 
not limited to photonics9, photovoltaics10, plasmonics11, nanofludics12, and sensing13. However,

despite the extensive research in the  field of particle self-assembly, it has not yet been utilized 
for scalable fabrication of nanoscale devices and systems, beyond research prototypes. The 
main reason for this is its inability to produce defect-free structures over large areas. While selfassembly can produce perfectly ordered architectures in short-range order, long-range order is 
plagued by defects such as empty patches or regions with multilayered particles. These defects 
render the assembled structures unsuitable for practical applications. For example, while 
colloidal lithography holds promise for optical applications, such as antireflective moth-eye 
structures14,15, structural defects act as scattering centers or diffraction gratings, preventing 
these structures from achieving their optimal antireflective performance as predicted by 
theory16,17. Similarly, defects produce diffusion scattering and degrade optical quality in selfassembled diffraction gratings and photonic crystals9. 
It is important to note that conventional colloidal lithography methods are based on particle selfassembly from the liquid-air interface. Alternatively, micro- and nanoparticles can be assembled 
using a "dry approach," which involves mechanical rubbing between two surfaces. This method 
organizes particles into ordered arrays driven by particle-particle and particle-surface attraction 
forces. Early demonstrations of rubbing on solid surfaces yielded limited particle 
organization18,19. However, later advancements using two elastomeric (PDMS) substrates 
achieved polycrystalline monolayers of Polystyrene with unprecedented quality, surpassing what 
is possible through wet-phase assembly20. Since then, there has been a growing interest in  
rubbing-based particle assembly, with recent works expanding this approach to particles of nonspherical shape21, particle material such as silica and PMMA22 , and applications in various areas 
including photonics23, biology24, and sensing25. Despite these advancements, rubbing-based 
methods of nano/micro- particle assembly into dense periodic array are still limited mostly to 
PDMS substrates, significantly restricting the potential applications of this promising fabrication 
method. An alternative approach includes assembly of Silica particle on other substrates coated 
with molecular glue such as Polyethyleneimine (PEI), with subsequent PEI pyrolysis in high 
temperature, but this process is incompatible with polymer particles18. To circumvent this 
limitation, we recently demonstrated that particle monolayers assembled on PDMS could be 
mechanically transferred to other substrates using thin PEI which can be then removed by 
dissolution26. However, this process is highly sensitive to glue thickness and process conditions, 
with the residual PEI layer severely limiting the pattern transfer through the particle mask and 
causing undesirable contamination when attempts were made to remove it. Thus, there is a 
critical need for a mechanical assembly and transfer method that can produce clean, defect-free 
particle assembly without introducing foreign materials. Such a method would unlock the 
potential of this fabrication approach for broader and more practical applications. 
Here, we introduce a novel colloidal lithography approach for fabricating micro- and 
nanoscale functional structures with highly controlled organization and density, which we term 
"ice-assisted transfer" (schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a). The process begins with the dry 
rubbing of nano- or microparticles between two PDMS surfaces, resulting in both surfaces being 
coated with highly dense and ordered polycrystalline particle monolayers. Subsequently, a drop 
of water is placed onto the monolayer-coated PDMS surface, and the target substrate is placed 
above and gently pressed against the PDMS substrate, resulting in the formation of a thin uniform 
water film sandwiched between the two surfaces. This "sandwich" is then frozen below the 

===== Page 3 =====

melting point of water, embedding the particle monolayer in the ice layer. The PDMS is then 
peeled off, leaving the ice film with embedded particle monolayer attached to the target surface. 
Finally, the ice is allowed to melt at room temperature, followed by gradual water evaporation, 
producing a high-quality, high-density polycrystalline particle monolayer on the target substrate. 
This process is performed without introducing any additional materials, ensuring a clean transfer 
process that does not interfere with subsequent patterning or fabrication steps. We first 
optimized the process parameters, and mostly the addition of surfactant to water, to obtain large 
area monolayers of particles of different sizes with high quality and lowest possible defect density 
(Fig. 1b). We then demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of this fabrication approach in two 
key applications: antireflective sub-wavelength structures for precision optics, and 3D structures 
designed for the mechanical activation of immune cells, which hold significant potential for 
advancing immunotherapy. Overall, this fabrication method unleash the potential of bottom-up 
nanostructuring for the development of engineered advanced nanoscale materials and 
functional systems.

film. (b) Image of a 4 inch Silicon wafer covered with ice-transferred particle monolayer and SEM 
images of the monolayer. 
To produce monolayers, we used polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes, ranging 
from 200 nm to 2 µm . We found that the quality and robustness of the process depend on several 
parameters, the most critical being the amount of water used for the transfer, and the addition 
of surfactant. Through empirical observation, we established a rule of thumb for the optimal 
water amount: the water film thickness should be approximately 20d+10 μm, where d is the 
particle diameter in microns. The thickness, in turn, can be precisely controlled through the 
volume of the water drop, which can be calculated considering the area of the target-PDSM 
interface. In all the experiments described herein, the natural weight of the target substate was 
enough to flatten the drop to an uniform film. Also, gentle Oxygen plasma treatment, which was 
usually used to clean the target surfaces prior to the sandwiching, produces hydrophilic surfaces 
that can facilitate the uniform water spreading. However, we found that uniform water film is 
formed also without such plasma treatment, probably due to mechanical weight of the target. 
The obtained water film that is sufficiently thick to embed the particles but thin enough to allow

for reasonable drying times. The final step of the process is technically comparable to selfassembly from a liquid phase, similar to conventional methods such as dip-coating or LangmuirBlodgett assembly. In this step, particle organization is driven by a well described mechanism 
highly dependent on particle-particle, particle-liquid, and particle-substrate interactions27, 
which are influenced by particle charge and wettability. 
 
The zeta potential of the nanoparticles, measured using dynamic light scattering, was 
approximately −30 mV (exact values are provided in Table S1), imparting a negative charge to the 
particles. This negative charge causes the particles to be attracted to the water solution during 
drying, leading them to flow with the water rather than maintaining a monolayer organization as 
formed during rubbing. To counteract this effect, the pH of the water-based solution was 
adjusted to 10 by adding ammonium hydroxide, which imparted a negative charge to the solution, 
repelling the negatively charged particles. Additionally, particle wettability was modified by 
adding a nonionic surfactant based on Octyl Phenol Ethoxylate (Triton TX-100) at varying 
concentrations.   
 
The effect of surfactant concentration qualitatively mirrors its impact as reported for 
assembly from the liquid phase28. Without surfactant, the resulting monolayer exhibited frequent 
and relatively large micron-scale defects in the form of empty patches (Fig. 2a). Adding surfactant 
at a concentration of 0.075 mM significantly reduced both the size and frequency of these 
defects. A further increase to 0.25 mM produced monolayers with minimal defects and large, 
well-defined monocrystalline domains. This structure is comparable to those formed in the initial 
stages of rubbing-based assembly on PDMS (Fig. S1). However, increasing the surfactant 
concentration to 0.4 mM led to the formation of particle clusters on top of the monolayer (doublelayer domains), which in turn created vacancies within the monolayer. Such clusters have been 
reported for the nanoparticle assembly from liquid phase 29,30. One proposed mechanism of their 
formation is related to the release of stresses in the nanoparticle lattice, which are formed due 
to simultaneous formation of the lattice domains on the solid surface at different places and with 
different orientations31. An alternatively proposed mechanism is associated with the 
accumulation of the particles on top of interstices formed in the first-layer lattice as the result of 
occasional sinking of some particles prior the liquid drying32. Notably, while Fig. 2a illustrates 
monolayers formed using 1 µm particles, similar qualitative trends in monolayer quality as a 
function of surfactant concentration were observed for other particle sizes as well, such as 500 
nm particles shown in Fig. S2. 
To quantify the quality of sphere arrangement as a function of surfactant concentration, 
we analyzed the SEM images using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), as described in detail in SI. For 
patterns obtained from pure water, as well as from water with 0.075 mM and 0.4 mM Triton 
concentrations, the FFT analysis showed ring patterns characteristic of polycrystalline 
structures with randomly oriented domains (Fig. 2a - insets). In contrast, the optimized 
concentration of 0.25 mM produced an FFT pattern indicative of uniform crystalline orientation, 
demonstrating superior monolayer quality. To further validate this, we quantified the FFT results 
by measuring the width of the first-order FFT peaks (Fig. 2b). The comparison of peak broadening 
confirmed that 0.25 mM surfactant concentration produced the highest order and quality of the 
formed particle monolayer. 
 
   
Also, the monolayer quality was quantified using Voronoi tessellation33 (Fig. 2c). This 
method involves determining the centers of the assembled particles as seed points, which divide 
the space into polygons, with each polygon containing all points closer to its seed point than to 
any other. This analysis allows for clear visualization of particle symmetry and defect types. The 
order of the assembly was further quantified using the Voronoi Regularity Index (RI), defined as 

===== Page 5 =====

the ratio of the standard deviation of polygon areas to their average area, and the Areal Disorder 
(AD) factor, calculated as:

(

                                                         )
 
 
 
 
where 𝐴̅ and  𝜎 are the average and standard deviation of polygon areas, respectively, with 
AD=0 indicating perfect particle order. Both the regularity index and the areal disorder factor were 
analyzed using at least six images for each Triton concentration and were found to reach their 
minimum values, as expected, at a concentration of 0.25 mM (Fig. 2e and f). Also, we analyzed 
the effect of surfactant concentration on defect occurrence (Fig. 2g). To differentiate defects 
caused by missing particles from empty areas at naturally occurring grain boundaries, defects 
were defined as empty regions with a minor axis larger than the sphere diameter. Figure 2d shows 
the total defect area as a function of Triton concentration, which also minimized at 0.25 mM.  
Finally, the average size of the grains formed in polycrystalline assembled structures is an 
additional merit of the assembly quality and order. Here, the largest grain size was obtained, as 
anticipated, for 0.25 mM surfactant concentration (Fig S3.) in Note, the bare polystyrene 
particles, lacking any functional groups covering their surface, were used in this study. The 
possible effect of such groups on the first part of the process (i.e., the rubbing step) is unclear 
and will be the subject of further investigation. As for the second part of the process, which 
involves particle monolayer formation during water evaporation, the water content—specifically, 
pH and surfactant concentration—may require further optimization depending on the functional 
groups present, as these groups alter the particle's zeta potential and influence their tendency to 
aggregate34.

It should be noted that the demonstrated nanofabrication approach produces highquality patterns within an impressively short processing time (a few minutes), in a cost-effective 
manner, and without requiring specialized equipment. Furthermore, this approach has many 
advantages over the previously demonstrated fabrication methods based on  rubbing-based 
colloidal assembly, including recently published by us colloidal assembly combined with PEIbased transfer PEI26. In particular, PEI layer connecting the micro-/nano-particles to the target 
surface often produces an obstacle for the pattern transfer method. Fig. S4 shows SEM images 
of Silicon etched though colloidal mask produced by PEI-assisted transfer, in which the pattern 
distortion due to PEI residuals are clearly seen. Similarly, PEI layer produces an obstacle for the 
pattern transfer by thin film deposition and liftoff. In functional application of the transferred 
colloids, PEI (or any other molecular glue) can attract to undesirable particle contamination.

Notable, PEI can be removed after the transfer by dissolution in ethyl alcohol, but this process is 
long (up to a few hours), barely controlled, and can lead to partial detachment of colloidal 
particles from the surface. On the contrary, ice assisted transfer method produces clean 
interface between the particle and target surface, with no presence of foreign material, ensuring 
easy and straight forward pattern transfer by any existing nanofabrication approach. The overall 
process is quick, and mostly depends on the freezing time, which takes about 15 – 30 minutes in 
standard freezer (-4oC), but can be shortened to up to 5 minutes by using -80oC freezer. Also, the 
melting and evaporation stage of the process can be expedited to 2-3 minutes by placing the 
surface to vacuum environment, such as pumped desiccator. 
 
These advantages of the ice-assisted colloidal transfer makes it well-suited for numerous 
applications requiring scalable nanopatterning, especially those incompatible with the 
expensive technologies used in microchip production. Here, we demonstrate two such 
applications. The first is the fabrication of antireflective nanostructures, commonly referred to 
as "moth-eye" structures due to their bioinspiration from the cornea of moths35. These structures 
consist of dense arrays of sub-wavelength cones or nipples. When scaled significantly below the 
wavelength of light, these structures act as an effectively homogeneous optical medium, with a 
refractive index gradient determined by the shape of the structures36. Properly designing the 
structure profile can achieve a broadband and omnidirectional antireflective effect that is 
unachievable with standard thin-film-based antireflective coatings. Additionally, moth-eye 
structures offer superior durability under thermomechanical stresses compared to antireflective 
films. Despite extensive research in this area, practical realization has been hindered by the lack 
of cost-effective yet reliable methods to fabricate these structures with controlled size and 
distribution. 
In this study, we designed moth-eye structures on silicon for the mid-IR spectrum, 
targeting a minimum reflectance around 2.8 microns. To achieve this, we assembled 1 µm 
particles on silicon using the described method with a Triton concentration of 0.25 mM. Particles 
assembled using pure water served as a control to demonstrate the importance of appropriate 
surfactant concentration for achieving optimal application outcomes. The particle monolayer 
was transferred to silicon, and used as a mask for silicon dry etching, which was followed by 
particle removal with acetone (details of all the fabrication processes appear in SI). SEM images 
of the etched moth-eye structures produced form colloidal masks assembled with and without 
Triton are shown in Fig. 3a and 3b. Fig. 3c presents high-magnification SEM images of the etched 
structures. Importantly, the structures produced with and without the surfactant were fabricated 
using the same etching process and exhibited identical geometry. Notably, the little elevated 
discs on top of the pillars are the result of the plasma under-etch in the Silicon areas which were 
not in the complete contact  with the masking polystyrene spheres. 
 
The obtained moth-eye structures were characterized by measuring the specular 
reflectance spectrum in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 microns (Fig. 3d). In both cases, substantially 
reduced reflection was achieved compared to bare silicon. Interestingly, the differences in the 
monolayers formed with and without surfactants were directly reflected in the antireflective 
performance of the fabricated structures. The surface structures produced using the surfactantassisted method exhibited an almost zero-reflection spectrum, with a minimum reflectance at 
approximately 2.8 microns. This minimum closely matched the theoretical reflection spectrum 
simulated using the transfer matrix method37. In contrast, identically shaped antireflective 
structures fabricated using pure water during the transfer process showed a minimum 
reflectance of around 5%. This imperfect antireflection effect is attributed to excessive defects 
in the microsphere monolayers produced without surfactants, particularly in the form of 
relatively large patches with missing particles. These defects were transferred to the etched 
patterns, creating unpatterned areas that contributed to overall reflection. Additionally, the

numerous defects scattered light, further increasing the measured reflection17,38. These results 
clearly demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate surfactant in the sphere transfer 
process: the surfactant not only improves the visible quality of the resulting microstructure but 
also significantly enhances its functional performance. 
 
 
We also applied this mechanical assembly method to produce broadband and 
omnidirectional antireflective structures on sapphire for the mid-IR spectrum. In this case, the 
structures were designed as periodic holes with a conical cross-section. The fabrication process 
involved sphere transfer onto sapphire coated with a Poly-(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) sacrificial 
film, followed by sphere diameter reduction using oxygen plasma, nickel evaporation (~40 nm), 
and the subsequent lift-off of PBMA and spheres. Here, the sacrificial PBMA layer (~100 nm) was 
added to produce an undercut in the nanosphere monolayer, and facilitate liftoff after the 
evaporation of the relatively thick metal film. The sapphire was then plasma-etched through the 
nickel mask, which was then stripped to reveal the final structure (Fig. S5a). Figure 3e shows the 
etched structures, featuring a conical shape with a depth of 600 nm (Fig. S5 b-c). Figure 3f 
presents the reflectance spectrum of the sapphire surface patterned with the antireflective 
structures, alongside the simulated spectrum of these structures (using the same method as 
used for silicon) and the spectrum of bare sapphire. The pronounced broadband antireflective 
effect observed in the patterned surface is likely due to the smooth refractive index gradient 
created by the sidewall profile of the etched holes, as also confirmed by the simulation.

The second application showcasing the benefits of our novel nanofabrication approach 
lies in the realm of nanostructured materials designed to interact with biological systems. T cells, 
a vital component of the adaptive immune system, play a crucial role in defending the body 
against pathogens, viruses, and stressed or mutated cells. In vivo, T cells are activated through 
the specific binding of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and costimulatory receptors to ligands expressed 
on antigen-presenting or target cells. Beyond these chemical ligand-receptor interactions, the 
physical characteristics of T-cell-target interfaces, such as the mechanical stiffness of activating 
surfaces and the nanoscale topography of the interacting membranes, significantly influence Tcell activation39–41. While the precise mechanisms underlying these physical effects remain 
unclear and are under intensive study, it is suggested that nanoscale protrusions on the T-cell 
membrane (microvilli) facilitate the separation of TCRs, concentrated at the protrusion tips, from 
large phosphatase molecules that inhibit activation signaling42–45. 
Surfaces structured with nanoscale topography and coated with activating ligands were 
shown to induce cell protrusion and enhance activation of T cells and of other lymphocytes such 
as natural killer (NK) cells46–50. Interestingly, the nanoscale topography of activating surfaces not 
only enhances ligand-induced activation but can also independently activate T cells to some 
extent, even in the absence of activating ligands51. While the mechanism behind such "purely 
mechanical" activation is not yet fully understood, it is evident that nanoscale topography can 
and should be harnessed for designing material-based platforms for ex-vivo T-cell activation. 
These platforms could be used both for mimicking T-cell environments in fundamental studies 
of activation mechanisms and for producing immunotherapeutic T cells with enhanced 
antitumor activity. 
A major challenge in employing nanotopography for ex-vivo T-cell activation platforms 
lies in their scalable fabrication. Top-down nanofabrication approaches adapted from electronic 
device production are extremely expensive and slow, making them unsuitable for producing 
large-area surfaces required for clinical-scale cell activation. We believe that our novel 
fabrication approach can address this challenge. To demonstrate this, we created large-area 
surfaces structured with arrays of nanowells designed to facilitate the formation of T-cell 
protrusions (Fig. 4a). This involved forming monolayers of 1 µm polystyrene nanospheres, 
reducing their diameter controllably using oxygen plasma, etching silicon through the resulting 
sphere masks, and stripping the nanospheres to create arrays of silicon nanopillars. These pillars 
were then negatively replicated onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce PDMS surfaces 
patterned with arrays of pores. The pore sizes were determined by the initial pillar diameter, and 
the periodicity was controlled by the original sphere diameter. These patterned surfaces were 
used for ligand-free T-cell stimulation. Pores with diameters of 200 nm, 400 nm, and 550 nm were 
fabricated, each with a periodicity of 1 µm (Fig. 4b and Fig. S6). Flat PDMS was used as a control 
to provide an environment devoid of topographic cues. 
We isolated peripheral mononuclear blood cells from a healthy donor and incubated 
them on the fabricated surfaces for 24 hours. The cells were then fixed, stained for membrane, 
cytoskeleton, and nucleus, and imaged using z-stack confocal microscopy (Fig. 4 c-e). All 
topographically patterned surfaces promoted the formation of T-cell nanoprotrusions that 
penetrated the pores, as clearly seen in the z-stack cross-sections. In parallel experiments, the 
cells were removed after incubation, labeled with antibodies against CD3 (a T-cell marker) and 
CD69 (an activation marker), and analyzed using flow cytometry to detect CD69 expression 
among CD3+ cells. From this data, we calculated the percentage of CD69-positive cells (detailed 
gating strategy in SI), shown in Fig. 4d. 
Flat PDMS produced a negligible amount of about 2% CD69 positive cells, likely due to 
tonic signaling of T cells.  Pores with diameters of 400 nm and 550 nm also produced negligible 
activation, similar to flat PDMS. However, pores with a diameter of 200 nm increased the 
proportion of activated cells four folds. While the overall activation level was still lower than that

typically achieved using ligand-coated surfaces that trigger activating and costimulatory 
receptors, the topography-induced activation effect is striking. Furthermore, the observed 
activation was size-dependent, with only certain pore sizes (200 nm) effectively inducing 
activation. This phenomenon mirrors findings by Aramesh et al., who reported similar sizedependent ligand-free activation using anodized alumina surfaces51. The mechanism behind 
pore-size-dependent ligand-free activation remains to be elucidated. It has been suggested that 
pores with diameters of 200 nm or smaller facilitate segregation between TCRs, concentrated at 
the protrusion tips, and large phosphatases such as CD45, due to the size of the latter51. This 
segregation, in turn, is believed to be the key factor in the mechanism of T cell activation52. We 
believe that the demonstrated fabrication route provides precise control over topographical 
geometry, enabling fine-tuning of topography-induced activation. This capability could pave the 
way for designing scalable platforms for fundamental research and clinical applications in 
immunotherapy.

multiple-comparison tests using the GraphPad Prism software. *p < 0.05 
In summary, the fabrication methods described in this paper offer significant 
advantages in producing high-quality, scalable, and cost-effective nanoscale patterns without 
the need for specialized equipment. By employing the novel "ice-assisted transfer" technique, 
the approach ensures clean, defect-free transfer of particle monolayers onto target substrates, 
overcoming the limitations of traditional colloidal lithography methods, which often produce 
defects over large areas. The process also allows precise control over particle arrangement and 
defect minimization through optimized surfactant-assisted assembly. This versatility enables 
the fabrication of functional structures, two examples of which were demonstrated here: 
antireflective "moth-eye" coatings for precision optics and nanostructured platforms for T-cell 
activation, demonstrating its utility across diverse applications. Additionally, the process 
achieves rapid patterning within minutes. This timescale is much shorter than that of state-ofthe-art colloidal lithography techniques, such as those based on Langmuir-Blodgett or dipcoating methods and is more comparable to the timescale of high-throughput lithography. On 
the other hand, the demonstrated process provides a patterning resolution (i.e., minimal 
separation between patterned objects) down to the sub-100 nm scale. This level of resolution is 
unachievable by standard UV-based photolithography and can only be reached using advanced 
deep-UV or extreme-UV photolithography. However, the latter are extremely expensive in terms 
of both equipment and operation, making them incompatible with applications beyond 
microchip production—such as the micro-/nanopatterning for optics or biomedicine 
demonstrated here. Overall, the unique combination of simplicity, low cost, high pattern 
resolution, excellent pattern quality, and fast processing time makes this method ideal for 
applications requiring scalable nanopatterning while remaining cost-efficient and adaptable for 
practical implementations across a wide range of fields requiring material shaping at the 
nanometric scale.

Materials Methods 
 
Generation of the particle monolayer 
Membranes of PDMS (Sylgard 184) were prepared by mixing PDMS and its hardener in 1:10 ratio 
(unless otherwise specified), followed by it casting on polished silicon wafer within a petri dish, and 
curing at 60 °C for 1 h. The resulting  PDMS was cut to pieces of desired size. A small amount (∼0.3 
mg per sq. inch of PDMS surface) of the nanoparticle powder was placed between two PDMS surfaces 
and rubbed, with the translational movement of the upper surface and rotational movement of the lower 
surface. A drop of water of the desired size (with or without surfactant ) was placed onto the target 
substrate, and covered by PDMS surface containing sphere monolayer, allowing the water to spread 
evenly between the two surfaces. The sandwich was placed in a freezer (-18oC) for at least half an hour, 
then taken out to the room temperature. Immediately, PDSM was pilled off the formed ice covering the 
target surface, and then it left until the complete melting of ice and evaporation of water.  
 
Pillar based moth-eye structures on Silicon 
For the antireflective structures on Silicon spectrum, the nanosphere size was first reduced from 1000 
nm to 860nm by dry etching in O2 plasma (Oxford Plasmapro 100 Cobra ,70 sccm O2, RF=100W, 
P=15mTorr, t = 3min). Then, the nanosphere pattern was transferred to Silicon by dry etching using 
(Oxford Plasmapro 100 Estrella, RF=20 W, ICP=800 W ,P=10 mTorr, 50sccm C4F8, 25sccm SF6, t = 
3min). Finally, the remaining microspheres were removed by sonication in chlorobenzene.    
 
Pore based moth-eye structures on Sapphire. Wafers of Sapphire (2.5 cm in diameter)  were first 
coated by PBMA using spin coating and baking, onto which an array of 1 μm polystyrene particles was 
transferred. Then, dry etching by O2 plasma (Oxford Plasmapro 100 Cobra, 70 sccm O2, RF = 100 W, 
p = 15 mTorr, t = 3:45 min) was used to reduce the particle diameter to 800 nm and create an undercut 
in PBMA. 270 nm nickel film was deposited by e-gun evaporation, following liftoff to obtain a Ni 
mask. Sapphire was etched through the mask (Oxford Plasmapro 100 Cobra, RF = 200 W, ICP = 1750 
W, p = 2 mTorr,   25 sccm BCl3, t = 6 min). Finally, Ni was removed by piranha solution.

Platform for T cell activation. 
 Silicon master mold was produced using 1 μm diameter polystyrene microspheres. The microsphere 
diameter was reduced to ~200,  400,500 nm by dry etching in O2 plasma (Oxford Plasmapro 100 Cobra, 
70 sccm O2, RF = 100 W, p = 20 mTorr \ Then, the microsphere pattern was transferred directly to the 
silicon by etching the silicon through the sphere mask (Oxford Plasmapro 100 Estrella mix gas, ICP = 
800 W, RF = 20 W,  25 sccm SF6,  25 sccm C4F8, p = 10 mTorr). The remaining microspheres were 
removed by sonication in chlorobenzene. The following steps included coating the mold with an 
antiadhesive agent, as described in our previous work1. PDMS (Sylgard 184 1:10) mixture was 
poured over the mold, cured for 1 hour at 60 oC, and pilled off.  
 
T cell activation. 
 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood using the FICOL gradient. First, 
blood was diluted with PBS augmented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), at a 1:1 ratio, then loaded 
on FICOL gradient, and centrifuged at 16 °C at 1200rpm (with no breaks or acceleration). The PBMCs 
were collected as the middle disc and a small portion of the underlying phase but taking care not to 
withdraw the pellet, washed three times with at least 1:2 with PBS 2% FBS at room temperature, and 
sedimented at 500 g. The cells were finally suspended in the final medium in the ratio of 2 mL per 7 
mL of collected blood, counted, and diluted with the medium to final concentration of 200,000 cells per 
100mL. The cells were then seeded onto ozone-treated PDMS surfaces, <2% serum and 50 units of IL2 and left inside the incubator to adhere for 24 h.  
For flow cytometry measurements, 50 000 cells were used per well. The cells were stained with 
respective fluorophore-conjugated antibodies at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. 
Thereafter, the cells were washed, and the dead cells were stained with DAPI (1:1000 in PBS). All the 
samples were analyzed on a CytoFLEX LX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For analysis, the 
fraction of CD3-positive cells was calculated, and CD3-positive cells were then analyzed for staining 
with the anti CD69. The antibodies used for staining were PE anti-human CD3 and APC anti-human 
CD69 (all from Biolegend).
