Quantum mechanics, derived from the Latin term ’quantum’ meaning ’quantity’, is a fundamental physics theory that
describes particle behavior at atomic and subatomic scales. It
has been pivotal in explaining phenomena in various fields,
such as atomic structure and superconductivity.
This perspective provides a forward-looking view of optical chips

QUANTUM MECHANICS HISTORY
In the late 19th century, several unresolved questions
emerged, challenging the foundations of classical physics.
One major issue was the stability of atoms.
According
to Maxwell’s theory and Hertz’s experiments, accelerating
charges emit radiation.
Consequently, orbiting electrons
should continuously lose energy and spiral into the nucleus,
yet atoms were observed to be stable.
Another significant

problem was understanding the emission of specific spectral lines in gas spectroscopy.
Although experiments confirmed these lines, their underlying mechanism remained unexplained. The photoelectric effect, discovered by Heinrich
Hertz in 1887, further complicated the classical understanding. Hertz observed that ultraviolet (UV) light increased the
conductivity of a material, but this effect was independent of
the light’s intensity below a specific frequency.
This contradicted classical predictions that intensity should influence
conductivity.
Additionally, the black body radiation problem, addressed by Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans in 1900,
revealed discrepancies between theoretical models and observed behaviors at shorter wavelengths, leading to what was
known as the ’UV catastrophe.’
Addressing these problems through several key discoveries led to the formulation of the ’old quantum theory,’ which
paved the way for the development of modern quantum mechanics.
The first fundamental discovery was the quantization of
energy and light. In 1900, Max Planck developed a theory
of blackbody radiation that matched experimental results by
proposing that the oscillations producing the waves are discrete and that the radiation is quantized into distinct units
of energy1. In 1905, Albert Einstein showed that the photoelectric effect, which was observed by Hertz, can be explained
via the quantization hypothesis presented by Plank2.
It is
worth noting that Einstein was describing photon, the term
’photon’ was only first introduced in 1916 by Leonard T.
Troland as ’A photon is that intensity of illumination upon
the retina of the eye.’3. Later in 1926, Gilbert N. Lewis used
the term photon as the unit of radiant energy - ’I, therefore,
take the liberty of proposing for this hypothetical new atom,
which is not light but plays an essential part in every process
of radiation, the name photon’4. This photon definition differs
from Einstein’s, which described it as light quantum (quanta).
Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr solved the big problem of
the stability of atoms. In 1911, Ernest Rutherford experimentally showed by bombarding thin gold foil with alpha particles
that atoms have a tiny nucleus with electrons cloud around it5.
In 1913 by adopting Rutherford’s nuclear structure to Max
Planck’s quantum theory, Niels Bohr presented his model of
the atom6 according to which electrons are around the nucleus
in a discrete set of orbits. The emission or the absorption of
light occurs when an electron jumps between the orbits.
The work of Plank, Einstein and Bohr (known as the ’old
quantum theory’) was the key to developing the theory of
quantum mechanics, known as the ’new quantum theory’.
In 1924, Louis De Broglie extended the theory of waveparticle duality from light to matter7, which became the base
of wave mechanics. He proposed that each moving particle
has an associated wave with a wavenumber proportional to
the particle’s momentum which he called a ’phase wave’. In
1927, his theory was confirmed by Davisson-Germer experiments, showing a diffraction pattern of reflected electrons
by crystals8–10.
In 1925, a new quantum theory was developed/presented. In 1925, Schrodinger described a quantum system by wave mechanics when the state of the quantum system is quantified by the wave function11. The square
of the wave function gives the probability density of finding a particle at a specific place at a specific time. In parallel to Schrodinger’s theory, Werner Heisenberg, with Max
Born and Pascual Jordan, presented matrix mechanics for describing quantum systems12–14.
The first consistent quantum mechanics unifying both contradicting views was developed by Paul Dirac. In 1925 after seeing Heisenberg’s paper,
Dirac developed a theory for non-commuting observables described by linear operators on Hilbert spaces and the bra-ket
notation, which is still used these days15. In 1928, he presented the Dirac equation16, a relativistic generalization of the
Schrodinger equation, adding the new variable spin, presented
by Wolfgang Pauli in 1924. These discoveries were the foundations of the modern quantum physics.

FROM FREE-SPACE TO CHIP
Quantum optics is a branch of quantum physics that studies light-matter interactions on the level of individual photons. Photons are excellent candidates for quantum information processing due to their high mobility and low interaction with the environment. Various applications are based on
quantum effects. Conventional quantum optical systems are
performed in free space on an optical setup with bulky and discrete optical components. Complex setups often require hundreds of components, necessitating a large optical table and
challenging system deployment. Additionally, these setups
require precise alignment and strict control over noise factors such as temperature and vibrations. Integrated photonics
provides a solution to these problems for quantum technologies. Integrated quantum photonics uses photonic integrated
circuits on a chip to control photonic quantum states for applications in quantum technologies. As such, integrated quantum photonics offers the only viable approach to the miniaturization and scaling up of optical quantum circuits. Figure 1 compares quantum circuits implemented in a free space
setup and a chip. It shows that a conventional quantum circuit
setup (Fig. 1a) requires a bulky and robust optical table while
a quantum circuit on a chip (Fig. 1b) can have a length of a
few millimeters.
Optical waveguides can control the light in microscale dimensions. The basic structure of an optical waveguide is a
substrate and a guiding layer19. The light is guided by total internal reflection and propagating in the guiding medium.
The first presentation of an optical guided wave structure was
in 1966 when a cylindrical fiber was proposed for guiding
light20. Since then, optical waveguides have been used for
a variety of applications21, from passive components (such as
directional couplers and sensors) to active components (such
as light sources and modulators). Optical waveguides offer
several advantages over bulk optics for quantum technology,
including miniaturization, integrability, scalability, stability,
and cost-effective production. Fabricating quantum devices
on a chip makes them smaller and more stable. Optical waveguides can be made from various materials, both active and passive, to suit specific quantum components and applications.
All necessary optical components can be integrated into a sin-

gle chip, creating a robust circuit that reduces errors caused
by vibrations or temperature fluctuations. Additionally, this
approach lowers the cost of mass production.

QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY DEVICES
A.
Materials platforms for quantum technology
Materials for on-chip nanophotonics are critical to the performance and functionality of photonic circuits22. Silicon has
long been the foundation of on-chip photonics, thanks to its
compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing23,24 and its
ability to form high-quality, low-loss waveguides25.
However, its limitations, such as an indirect bandgap, have led
to exploring alternative materials. Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is
notable for its lower propagation losses and effectiveness in
the visible and near-infrared spectra26–29. III-V semiconductors, like gallium arsenide (GaAs)30,31 and indium phosphide
(InP)32,33, are known for their direct bandgap properties, allowing efficient light emission and detection, making them
ideal for active devices such as lasers and modulators. Emerging materials, including lithium niobate (LiNbO3)34–37 and
two-dimensional materials like graphene38–41 and transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)42–44, bring unique electrooptic, nonlinear, and plasmonic properties, enhancing the capabilities of on-chip photonic systems.
Research into hybrid platforms that integrate these diverse materials aims to
combine their strengths, enabling more versatile and highperformance nanophotonic devices.
Advances in materials science and nanofabrication are driving this field forward, opening up new possibilities for quantum computing,
telecommunications, and other cutting-edge applications.
Quantum photonic circuits comprise several key building
blocks, as previously mentioned. Quantum-integrated photonics combines different components, such as light sources
and detectors, onto a single chip. Optical waveguides can be
fabricated from monolithic or hybrid materials, making them
ideal configurations for quantum technologies. Table I lists
standard materials used in quantum devices, each with unique
properties suited to various quantum applications.
Different components may require different materials depending on
their specific function. For instance, the silicon-on-insulator
is CMOS-compatible and can be used for photon-pair generation via four-wave mixing45,46 but is most efficient for singlephoton detection at 1550 nm. Monolithic circuits, made from
a single material, such as III-V semiconductors like gallium
arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), enable the integration of multiple components, including light sources and
detectors, on one chip.
B.
Single-photon sources
The concept of a single-photon source was first introduced
by Planck in 1900. A single-photon source emits one photon
at a time with a known and identical mode, such as frequency
or temporal mode, which is crucial for quantum technologies.
However, an ideal single-photon source does not yet exist, and
ongoing efforts aim to create sources that closely approximate
this ideal. Two primary methods for generating single-photon
sources are isolated quantum systems (also known as singleemitter systems) and photon pair sources, as shown in Fig. 2a.
Another method for creating single-photon sources is by multiplexing one or more photon pair sources, as illustrated in
Fig. 2b.
Isolated quantum systems are deterministic sources that
emit one photon at a fixed time but with an efficiency of less
than 100%. For example, quantum dots55–57, single ions58–60
and single atoms. Notably, quantum dots can be used in both
isolated quantum systems and photon pair sources. The second method, photon pair sources, generates pairs of correlated
photons, where the detection of one photon (’twin’) indicates
the presence of the other. Unlike isolated quantum systems,
photon pair sources guarantee photon emission.
However,
since they rely on nonlinear processes, they are probabilistic in nature. Photon pair sources are typically based on two
nonlinear effects: spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) and four-wave mixing (FWM). Parametric downconversion is related to the second order susceptibility χ(2)

and can occur in crystals such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
and gallium arsenide (GaAs). In the SPDC process, one pump
photon is split into signal and idler photons. Four-wave mixing is related to the third order susceptibility χ(3) and is based
on the atomic structure of centrosymmetric materials such as
silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (Si3N4). In the FWM
process, two pump photons are converted into a pair of signal
and idler photons.
In 1974, the first source of entangled photons was created48.
By splitting the first and second atoms of an atomic cascade in mercury atoms, as shown in Fig. 2c, they observed
one photon per pulse. One limitation of free-space singlephoton sources is their bulkiness. Integrated photonics allows
the fabrication of small single-photon sources with chip-scale
dimensions. Integrated quantum photonics can create highbrightness sources because of the high confinement in optical waveguides. Due to the high power confinement in optical waveguides, the non-linear effects, such as spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing
(FWM), are enhanced.
In addition, it decreases insertion
losses that occur in the fiber/chip interface. A single photon source can be created using quantum dots and periodically poled nonlinear crystals (quasi-phase matching). Quantum dots are a good candidate for photon sources due to the
near-ideal single-photon emission and entangled photon-pair
generation. Quantum dot can be embedded in a photonic crystal waveguide49,61 as shown in Fig. 2d. The photonic crystal waveguide can achieve a near-unity probability for a single exciton (β = ∼98%) that can be utilized for highly efficient single-photon source49. Quantum dot can also be integrated on a waveguide by layered semiconductor50 as shown
in Fig. 2e. A layer of gallium selenide (GaSe) single crystal
with a thickness of 90 nm was placed on Si3N4 rib waveguide
for coupling a single-photon source to a waveguide. The integration can be improved by III-V semiconductor GaAs with
Self-assembled InAs/GaAs QD heterogeneous fabricated on
a silicon nitride51 as shown in Fig. 2f. The advantage of using GaAs is its well-established fabrication processes, which
facilitate the fabrication of desired applications. For example,
in the integrated silicon nitride waveguide, the GaAs layer can
be designed and fabricated as a tapered waveguide for better
mode conversion and as a photonic crystal reflector for high
efficiency.
Another method for generating single-photon sources on
a waveguide is quasi-phase-matching (QPM) nonlinear frequency conversion, achieved by periodically poling a nonlinear crystal62. By applying an electric field on a material with
ferroelectric properties, as illustrated in Fig. 2g, the signs of
the elements in χ(2) tensor are switched, which can be manipulated in the required configuration for QPM. One of the materials that can be periodically poled is lithium niobate (LN -
LiNbO3)63. Lithium niobate is an artificial ferroelectric crystal with strong χ(2) nonlinearity. A quasi-phase matching is
obtained by periodic poling along the propagation direction
of the LN waveguide, which offsets the mismatch between
the interacting waves as shown in Fig. 2g. The phase matching can be used for efficient nonlinear effects on a waveguide,
such as second-harmonic generation52. This method was first
introduced in 1993 for developing a blue laser using secondharmonic generation64. Figure 2h shows a periodically poled
lithium niobate microring waveguide for a photon pair source
at a wavelength of 1.55 µm53. Other materials for periodically
poled waveguides are Potassium titanyl phosphate (KTiOPO4,
KTP) and its isomorphs (KTP family). Figure 2i shows a photon pair source in periodically poled rubidium (Rb) exchanged
Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (Rb:KTP) waveguide around
800 nm54. It achieved a high nonlinear conversion efficiency
(2%/W · cm2) and low-temperature sensitivity (39 pm/K),
demonstrating excellent potential for sources in the visible
spectrum. KTP presents unique advantages that could surpass
LN in various high-power and visible-light applications. Notably, KTP’s lower photorefractive damage threshold and reduced coercivity fields make it a promising candidate for periodically poled waveguides. These properties open avenues for
KTP’s use in high-power environments and support the fabrication of dense quasi-phase-matching (QPM) gratings suitable for visible wavelengths—applications where lithium niobate (LN) faces limitations. However, challenges remain in
optimizing KTP’s crystal growth, which currently requires
more costly techniques and yields smaller crystal sizes. Overcoming these hurdles could significantly expand KTP’s role
in photonic device innovation.
As mentioned, a significant drawback of photon pair
sources is that their generation process is probabilistic, which
poses a problem for quantum applications. A way to overcome this drawback is to convert a probabilistic source into a
deterministic source by multiplexing, as illustrated in Fig. 2b.
In 2001, Clausen proposed the concept of multiplexing using an optical feedback loop65.
In 2002, Pittman showed
the first experimental demonstration of multiplexing with a
periodic time interval using a storage loop and an optical
switch66. One method for multiplexing is multiplexing many
photon pair sources to create a deterministic single-photon
source67,68. The important component of sources multiplexing is the optical switch. The optical switch, such as optoceramic switches69 and electro-optic switches70, gets feedback from the heralding detector and switches the herald photon to the output. Another method is multiplexing a singlephoton source in time or frequency47,71.
A probabilistic
source generates photons at random times, and the heralding
detector collects the timing. The herald photons are introduced into a delay system, while the switch adjusts the repetition rate according to the recorded timing.
While single-photon sources can be integrated on a chip, efficient coupling of the high-power pump source to the waveguide remains essential to ensure sufficient excitation.
The
common method for enhancing the coupling efficiency is buttcoupling using a lensed fiber. Lensed fibers can focus the light
to a spot size of 1 µm, which reduces the large mismatch
between the waveguide dimensions and light spot size, increasing the coupling efficiency. Butt-coupling using a lensed
fiber offers a straightforward and broadband-compatible approach, providing higher coupling efficiency than standard
single-mode fibers. This method has been widely employed
for interfacing various waveguide-integrated single-photon
sources.51,53,72. For achieving a higher coupling efficiency,

===== Page 6 =====

a grating coupler can be fabricated on the waveguide, enhancing the coupling efficiency of the needed wavelength. Grating
couplers operate based on the Bragg condition, making them
inherently wavelength-selective and suitable only for a specific, pre-designed wavelength. It can achieve a coupling efficiency of ∼80%73,74. The grating can be in a tapered shape,
focusing the light into the waveguide50,75. Implementing a
tapered grating coupler in a single-photon source waveguide
can be seen in Fig. 2e. It is worth noting that lensed fiber
can be used for focusing the incident light into the grating in
a small spot size, making the grating more compact. The coupler can be designed as a gradient grating or a metasurface,
introducing distinctive propagation characteristics within the
waveguide76–79. Another method that can be used is an edge
coupler. It can achieve 90% coupling efficiency and can support broadband operation80.
C.
Single photon detectors
Detecting a single photon is a complex yet crucial task for
advancing quantum technology. Integrating single-photon detectors onto waveguides enables miniaturization and reduces
optical coupling losses when interfacing with fibers, paving
the way for more efficient and compact quantum devices.
Several requirements must be met to achieve an ideal singlephoton detector. First, it must be susceptible and capable of
detecting a single photon at 100% efficiency. Second, a few
crucial parameters of the detectors must equal zero: the dark
count rate, the dead time (or recovery time), and the timing
jitter. Another essential attribute of a single-photon detector is its ability to resolve the number of photons in a pulse.
Single-photon detectors are divided into non-photon-numberresolving detectors and photon-number-resolving detectors.
The vast majority of single-photon detectors today are nonphoton-number-resolving, distinguishing only between the
presence and absence of photons rather than counting individual photons. Since the first demonstration of single-photon
detection using the photomultiplier tube (PMT) in 1949, the
quest for effective photon detection has continued to evolve.
The PMT, though able to amplify the signal up to 106 electrons, operates with limited efficiency (10–14%) and requires
a vacuum tube, impacting its reliability, longevity, and size.
Today, the single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) or Geigermode avalanche photodiode (G-APD), conceived by Jun-ichi
Nishizawa in 1952, has emerged as a highly practical alternative. By applying a high reverse bias just above the breakdown voltage in the p-n junction, SPADs utilize impact ionization, also known as the avalanche effect, to generate a
self-sustaining current upon photon absorption. This Geigermode operation, introduced in the 1960s, presents a streamlined pathway for single-photon detection in compact, scalable designs, positioning SPADs as a cornerstone for advancing quantum technology and integrated photonics86,87. SPADs
are fast and have low noise, but have low quantum efficiency
(nd ≈65%). The advantage of SPAD is that it can operate at
room temperature or slightly below it. In 2017, a lateral germanium (Ge) avalanche photodiode operating in Geiger mode
was integrated on a silicon waveguide as a single-photon
detector82 as shown in Fig. 3c. It achieved single-photon detection with an efficiency of 5.27% at an operation temperature of 80K.
The emergence of superconducting nanowire single-photon
detectors (SNSPDs) marks a significant advancement in photon detection technology. These innovative devices have the
potential to transform the landscape of quantum optics and
photonics, offering enhanced sensitivity and efficiency that
could pave the way for new applications and breakthroughs
in quantum information science81,88. SNPADs can achieve
higher efficiency (> 90%), low dark count rate (< 0.01 cps)
and high count rate from visible to near-infrared. Currently, a
superconducting nanowire is applied close to the critical current. When even a single photon is absorbed, it contributes
to the average resistivity. It greatly enhances the detection efficiency but requires a cryogenic temperature to operate. It
was first presented in 2001 by a microbridge from niobium
nitride films on sapphire substrate81. At a wavelength of 0.81
µm, they achieved quantum efficiency of 20% for 0.81 µm
photons, negligible dark counts and response time of ∼100
ps. A few years later, the efficiency increased to 67%88 while
reaching above 90% efficiency89. In 2011, the first superconducting nanowire single photon detector on a waveguide was
presented83 as shown in Fig. 3d. Niobium nitride nanowires
were fabricated on a GaAs ridge waveguide for sensing the
evanescent field, achieving ∼20% efficiency at the telecommunication range.
A key property of single-photon detectors is their photonnumber-resolving (PNR) capability. It is essential when photon number counting is important in quantum protocols such
as quantum computing and quantum communication.
A
transition-edge sensor (TES) can achieve PNR and be utilized for quantum applications90. It acts as a bolometer for
single-photon detection. The temperature of a metallic detecting area is maintained at a superconducting state close to the
ohmic state. The absorption of a photon causes a small rise
in the temperature, which increases the resistance at a linear
response, assuming that not too many photons are absorbed.
The resistance is measured by an integrating circuit and the
number of photons is calculated. TES was integrated on a
lithium niobate waveguide, as shown in Fig. 3e, achieving a
resolution of up to 6 photons at 1550 nm84. The main drawback of TES is a slow operation, two orders of magnitude
higher than the needed speed for quantum computing91,92.
Another solution is modifying an SNSPD for PNR quantum
applications. By fabricating four niobium nitride (NbN) superconducting nanowires on a GaAs waveguide, as shown in
Fig. 3f, a four-photon resolution was achieved85. The main
drawback is that both TES and SNSPD require cryogenic temperatures to operate, limiting their applications.

be controlled. Each dimension opens up unique avenues for
encoding and processing quantum information. For instance,
the polarization states of photons in a waveguide can be harnessed for polarization-encoded qubits, providing a robust
framework for quantum computation and communication. To
achieve this level of control, a diverse array of structures can
be employed to manipulate these degrees of freedom. The
efficacy of such manipulations is significantly enhanced by
optical elements, such as polarization splitter-rotators93,94, directional couplers95, phase shifters96,97 and Mach-Zehnder interferometers, which can be integrated into optical waveguides, facilitating intricate photon management and fostering
advancements in quantum technologies. The Pockels electrooptic effect or thermo-optic effect can be used to perform
phase modulation. The Pockels effect, on the one hand, can
be utilized for high-speed applications98, but is limited to noncentrosymmetric materials, such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
and gallium arsenide (GaAs).
The thermo-optic effect, on
the other hand, can be utilized for slow-speed applications97
and is readily achievable in silicon. Integrated photonics can
achieve polarization modulation more effectively than free
space. While free space requires bulky optical components,
an optical waveguide can achieve polarization manipulation
by a laser-written twisted waveguide99,100.

APPLICATIONS AND THE FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Optical chips are revolutionizing quantum photonics by
providing compact, scalable, and highly efficient platforms
for manipulating the quantum states of light. Unlike conventional bulk optical systems, these chips integrate intricate optical circuits onto a single chip, allowing precise photon control
while significantly reducing noise and environmental interferences. This breakthrough has catalyzed a wide array of applications, including quantum communication, cryptography,
ultra-sensitive sensing, and quantum computing.
As the technology evolves, optical chips are emerging as
pivotal components for next-generation quantum technologies. This chapter explores the transformative applications of
optical chips in quantum photonics, highlighting innovations
in integrated photonic circuits, single-photon sources, and
quantum gate operations. By enabling scalable, reliable, and
commercially viable solutions, optical chips are unlocking
new possibilities for advancing quantum systems and reshaping the technological landscape.

Quantum computing holds great potential to enhance classical computing and can be leveraged to solve complex problems, including those in data science and quantum chemistry. It exploits quantum phenomena such as entanglement
and superposition to achieve higher computational capabilities. Mathematician Yuri Manin first proposed quantum computing in 1980105, and a year later, Richard Feynman pro-

posed it106. Feynman declared that quantum system couldn’t
be simulated with the classical system; ’Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature,
you’d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly, it’s a
wonderful problem because it doesn’t look so easy’.
Photons are light particles that can be manipulated and
controlled to carry and process quantum information.
In
photonics-based quantum computing, qubits are encoded in
the quantum states of photons and serve as the basic components of quantum computing. As opposed to binary codebased machines where a bit can only have values of 0 and 1,
a quantum bit (or qubit) can store information in the superposition of states; |ψ⟩= α|0⟩+ β|1⟩where α and β are complex numbers (|α|2 + |β|2=1). Superposition enables quantum computing to tackle problems with high computational
complexity. Each additional qubit doubles the computational
space, resulting in an exponential increase that reaches 2n
states. In classical computing, achieving the same computational space requires doubling the number of bits, resulting in
significantly slower growth in capacity. The two most widely
used methods for encoding qubits in photons are polarization
encoding and path encoding. Quantum logic gates, such as the
Controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard (H), and Toffoli gates,
are crucial for manipulating quantum information. The first
quantum logic gate integrated on a chip was introduced in
2008, marking a key milestone in the development of quantum photonics on integrated platforms107.
Quantum simulators are an important application of quantum computers.
Quantum simulators simulate and solve
complex computational problems by using entanglement and
many-particle quantum phenomena. The first quantum simulator was in 2002. A Rb Bose-Einstein condensate was used
to observe a quantum phase transition108.
B.
Quantum sensing and metrology
Quantum sensing and metrology are among the most
promising fields within quantum information science.
It
is the measurement of physical quantities using quantum
mechanical laws for sensitivity beyond the classical limit,
such as atomic clocks109, nuclear magnetic and paramagnetic
resonances110,111, and electron microscopes.
For example,
classical measurements with a clock can achieve time resolution of femtoseconds (10−15 seconds) to attoseconds (10−18
seconds).
Modern atomic clocks, particularly optical lattice clocks and ion-based atomic clocks, achieve resolutions
far beyond those of classical clocks. State-of-the-art atomic
clocks, such as those based on strontium or ytterbium in optical lattice setups, can achieve timing resolution on the order
of attoseconds. This is achieved by exploiting atomic transitions in the optical range, where higher frequencies allow for
finer time division. Quantum sensing can probe temperature,
electric and magnetic fields, forces, etc. Various research areas can benefit from the enhanced sensitivity of quantum sensing, including biological systems, spectroscopy and frequency
measurements, gravitational wave detection, and magnetometry.
Phase estimation allows quantum systems to achieve measurement precisions that surpass the standard quantum limit
(SQL), which bounds classical measurement accuracy due to
quantum noise. Therefore, phase estimation is highly preferable and widely used in quantum metrology. This technique
is foundational for achieving high precision in measurements

at the quantum level, as it enables the detection of extremely
small changes in physical quantities.
The super-resolution
for phase estimation is more accessible and less demanding.
The most common method to estimate the phase shift between two optical paths is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer
(MZI)112,113.
Integrated circuits enable scalable experimental platforms,
providing control over noise effects such as temperature and
vibrations, which facilitates precise phase control that is challenging to achieve in bulk optical setups. A promising platform for quantum sensing is the photonic crystal, which can
be engineered with a photonic bandgap114,115. Solid dielectric
high-Q cavities, such as disk resonators116, ring resonators117,
and Mie nanoparticle resonators118,119, offer another viable
platform. These structures can be used to implement singlephoton-controlled gates.
Quantum atomic clocks have enabled timekeeping to reach
the attosecond range, achieving resolutions and stabilities far
beyond classical limitations.
Their accuracy, measured in
parts per quintillion, is foundational to advancing fields like
navigation, telecommunications, and fundamental physics.
C.
Quantum cryptography
Quantum cryptography utilizes quantum mechanics for
cryptographic tasks such as quantum key distribution (QKD),
quantum money and random number generator (RNG) to
name a few. Photons have less interaction with the environment, saving the coded information. The fundamental concept behind Quantum cryptography is the no-cloning theorem.
Quantum cryptography utilizes photons in quantum entanglement, where two photons are linked to each other. In 1982,
Wootters and Zurek demonstrated that it is impossible to clone
a quantum system or state120. When one attempts to measure
a single photon, a change occurs in the other photon, preventing the information from being cloned or read.
1.
Quantum key distribution - private key and public key
In the 1960s, the idea of Quantum cryptography (private
key) was first proposed by Stephen Wiesner.
He wrote a
paper in 1968 but didn’t publish it till 1982121.
Later in
1984, building upon Stephen Wiesner’s pioneering concept
of quantum money and conjugate coding, Charles Bennett
and Gilles Brassard introduced a groundbreaking protocol for
quantum key distribution (QKD), known as BB84. This protocol leveraged the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics—such as the no-cloning theorem and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle—to enable two parties to securely generate
a shared cryptographic key while ensuring that any eavesdropping attempt would be detectable. By encoding information
in the polarization states of single photons, BB84 established
the foundation for modern quantum cryptography, laying the
groundwork for secure communication resistant to computational attacks.
Security relies on the use of an unpredictable key, which is
generated by quantum random number generators (QRNGs).
Unlike pseudo-random number generators, which follow deterministic patterns, quantum random number generators
(QRNGs) produce genuinely random numbers. The integration of quantum photonics technology significantly reduces
device size, making QRNGs more compact and practical for
secure applications.
In summary, optical chips for quantum photonics represent a transformative technology that integrates photonics and
quantum mechanics to manipulate light at the quantum level.
These chips are essential for advancing quantum computing, secure communication, and precision sensing by enabling
the controlled manipulation of single photons. Key developments, including low-loss waveguides, efficient single-photon
sources, and high-fidelity quantum gates, have significantly
enhanced scalability and performance. Recent advances in
materials science and nanofabrication, particularly in silicon
photonics, have further enhanced chip precision and integration with classical electronics. As research progresses, optical
chips are poised to revolutionize quantum technologies, enabling compact quantum processors, ultra-secure communication networks, and highly precise measurement systems.
