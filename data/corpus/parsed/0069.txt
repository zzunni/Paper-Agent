Generation of single photons has been demonstrated in several systems. However, none of them
satisﬁes all the conditions, e.g. room temperature functionality, telecom wavelength operation, high
eﬃciency, as required for practical applications. Here, we report the fabrication of light emitting
diodes (LEDs) based on intrinsic defects in silicon carbide (SiC). To fabricate our devices we used
a standard semiconductor manufacturing technology in combination with high-energy electron irradiation. The room temperature electroluminescence (EL) of our LEDs reveals two strong emission
bands in visible and near infrared (NIR), associated with two diﬀerent intrinsic defects. As these
defects can potentially be generated at a low or even single defect level, our approach can be used
to realize electrically driven single photon source for quantum telecommunication and information
processing.

Robust and cheap light sources emitting single photons on demand are at the heart of many demanding optical technologies [1, 2]. Single photon emission has been
demonstrated in a variety of systems, including atoms [3],
ions [4], molecules [5–7], quantum dots (QDs) [8, 9] and
color centers in diamond [10, 11]. The most signiﬁcant
progress has been achieved for QDs [12–14], however, the
necessity to use cryogenic temperatures and high inhomogeneity (the emission wavelength is individual for each
QD) make this system impractical. Electrically driven
single photon sources in visible have also been demonstrated using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond
[15, 16], but the compatibility of this system with the
present-day integrated circuits manufacturing is not obvious.
The operation principle of single photon sources is
based on the quantum mechanical properties of a single two-level system. When a single photon is desired,
this system is put into the excited state by an external
stimulus, and a single photon is emitted upon relaxation
into the ground state. A perspective approach to fabricate an eﬃcient, room temperature single photon source
based on this principle is to use color centers in semiconductors. In our work, we exploit two defect centers in
SiC, the so-called D1 defect [17] and the silicon vacancy
(VSi) defect [18], making two-color LED [Fig. 1(a)].
Remarkably, the VSi defects in SiC comprise the technological advantages of semiconductor quantum dots and
the unique quantum properties of the NV defects in diamond [19]. In particular, VSi spin qubits can be optically
initialized and read out, and, therefore, our demonstration of room temperature EL from VSi defects is an important step towards realization of all-electrical control
of VSi spins. Further, the VSi EL reveals a broad-band
emission spectrum in NIR (850 −1050 nm), where the

While this spectrum range is still below the telecom window (1.3 µm), it can be changed in the direction of long
wavelengths by proper choosing over family of VSi-related
defects in diﬀerent SiC polytypes. Alternatively, the frearXiv:1212.2989v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  12 Dec 2012

The bandgap of 6H-SiC is Eg(SiC) = 3.05 eV.
quency conversion of NIR photons to a telecom wavelength can be applied [20, 21]. Therefore, the integration
of defect-based SiC LEDs with existing telecommunication infrastructure seems feasible.
SiC with highly developed device technologies (e.g.
MOSFETS, MEMS, sensors) is a very attractive material for practical applications. SiC is also known as the
material on which the ﬁrst LED has been created [22].
Until the 90’s, SiC was used for commercial yellow and
blue LEDs, but later it was replaced with GaN. The reason is that SiC is an indirect bandgap semiconductor and
as a consequence direct band-to-band radiative recombination is ineﬃcient. For the same reason, recombination
through defects is preferential in SiC [Fig. 1(b)]. If one
would isolate a single defect with radiative recombination
channel, this property of SiC could be used to eﬃciently
generate single photons.
The LED structures used in our experiments were
grown on a n-type 6H-polytype SiC substrate [Fig. 1(a)].
First, an epitaxial 15-µm-thick SiC layer was grown by
the sublimation method. The layer is n-type with donor
concentrations of 3 × 1018 cm−3 (N). It also contains Ga
impurities (2 × 1018 cm−3), serving as PL activation centers. The layer is followed by a p-type SiC layer of thickness 5 µm grown at a temperature of 2300 C◦in Ar atmosphere in the presence of Al vapors (pressure 100 Pa).
This results in the concentration of Al acceptors of ca.
1020 cm−3. In order to generate intrinsic defects at the pn junction the samples were irradiated with 0.9 MeV electrons to a dose of 1018 cm−2. After irradiation, the samples were annealed for 10 minutes in Ar atmosphere at a
temperature of 1700 C◦. At the ﬁnal stage, 0.4×0.4 mm2

Al contacts were deposited on the top of the p-type SiC
layer.
We mount LED samples on a Cu plate serving as the
back electrode.
Upon applying voltage between an Al
contact and the Cu plate the luminescence glow is seen
by the naked eye [Fig. 2(a)]. The room temperature EL
spectrum of one of our LEDs is presented in Fig. 2(b). It
consists of two broad emission bands, labeled as D1 and
VSi. The corresponding recombination processes at the
p-n junction are schematically shown in Fig. 1(b).
We now discuss the EL bands of Fig. 2(b) in details.
Remarkably, the corresponding emission energies are signiﬁcantly smaller than the bandgap of 6H-SiC (3.05 eV).
We, therefore, ascribe them to the defects in SiC. The
emission in the spectral range 450 −650 nm is characteristic for the D1 defect [17]. The nature of this defect is
still not clear – several models have been proposed, including bound-exciton-like center [23] and ﬁrst-neighbor
antisite pair SiC −CSi [24]. The second emission band in
the NIR spectral range 850 −1050 nm coincides with the
photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the silicon vacancy
defects VSi [25] in the reference 6H-SiC bulk sample.
To prove this interpretation we repeat the experiment

of Fig. 2(b) at a temperature of 77 K [see Fig. 3(a)], when
the spectroscopic features individual for each defect can
be resolved.
In this low-temperature experiment, the
samples are kept in vacuum and the Cu plate is also used
as a cold ﬁnger. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 and
below we discuss them in details.
First, we demonstrate the presence of VSi defects in
our LED structures.
Figure 3(b) shows photoluminescence (PL) spectrum recorded under excitation with the
energy Eexc = 1.96 eV, which is below the D1 emission energy. Three zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) at 1.368 eV,
1.398 eV and 1.434 eV are the well known ﬁngerprint of
the VSi defects in 6H-SiC [26]. These three ZPLs originate from three nonequivalent crystallographic sites in
this SiC polytype and are frequently labeled as V3, V2,
and V1, respectively. The highest ZPL intensity is observed for VSi(V1).
Second, we demonstrate that the VSi(V1) defect can
be electrically driven. Figure 3(a) shows EL spectrum
recorded at T = 77 K. In contrast to room temperature
[Fig. 2(b)], the D1 emission dominates in the spectrum.
The reason is the much higher concentration of D1 defects than of VSi defects. However, the activation energy
of the D1 defect is relatively small (57 meV [27]), leading to the intensity increase with lowering temperature.
On the other hand, the activation energy of the VSi defects is much higher and their intensity weakly depends
on temperature.
Indeed, we observe the characteristic
VSi(V1) ZPL at 1.434 eV in the EL spectrum [the inset
of Fig. 3(a)].
Third, we verify that the electrical excitation of the
VSi(V1) defect shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a) is not due
to the re-emission process via D1. We excite PL with the
energy of 2.62 eV, coinciding with the maximum of the
D1 EL band [Fig. 3(a)]. The laser intensity per area is
several orders of magnitude higher than that of the D1
emission, but no signiﬁcant enhancement of the VSi(V1)
PL is observed. This means that while the reemission
may potentially take place, it is ineﬃcient as compared
to electrical excitation. Therefore, we conclude, the recombination of electrically injected electron and holes is
responsible for the VSi EL, as schematically shown in
Fig. 1(b).
Finally, we present an input-output characteristic of
one of our LED devices [Fig. 3(c)].
A clear tendency
to saturation of the emission intensity P with injection
current I is seen. This behavior can be well described as
P ∝(1 + I0/I)−α [the solid line in Fig. 3(c) corresponds
to α = 0.75 ]. The characteristic saturation current I0 =
17 mA is higher than that in QD-based single photon
LEDs [28] and comparable with that in NV-based single
photon LEDs [16].
In conclusion, we generated intrinsic defects in SiC devices and demonstrated that these defects can be electrically driven, resulting in the eﬃcient EL with emission
energies well below the SiC bandgap. Our LEDs are twocolor in a sense that they show two spectrally diﬀerent
emission bands associated with diﬀerent defects. The D1
defects show EL in visible, which is intense at low temperatures but quenches with rising temperature.
The
VSi defects emit in NIR even at room temperature. By
varying the irradiation dose one can control defect concentration, which should allow to isolate single defects,
similar to single NV centers in diamond or single semiconductor QDs. Because isolated defects are ideal single
photon emitters, our ﬁndings open a new way to fabricate cheap and robust LEDs emitting single photons on
demand in NIR.
