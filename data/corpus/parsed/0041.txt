Squeezed-light generation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is essential
for scalable continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. By
suppressing quantum fluctuations below the shot-noise limit, squeezed states
enable quantum-enhanced sensing and serve as a standard resource for CV
quantum information processing. While chip-level squeezed-light sources have
been demonstrated, extending this capability to the wafer level with reproducible strong squeezing to bolster large-scale quantum-enhanced sensing and
information processing has been hindered by squeezed light’s extreme susceptibility to device imperfections. Here, we report wafer-scale fabrication,
generation, and characterization of two-mode squeezed-vacuum states on a
fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon
nitride (Si3N4) PIC platform. Across a 4-inch wafer, 8 dies yield 2.9-3.1 dB
directly measured quadrature squeezing with < 0.2 dB variation, demonstrating excellent uniformity. This performance is enabled by co-integrating
ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled high-Q microresonators, cascaded pumprejection filters, and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers. The measurements
agree with a first-principles theoretical model parameterized solely by independently extracted device parameters and experimental settings. The measured
squeezing level can be further improved by enhancing the efficiencies of off-chip
detection and chip-to-fiber coupling. These results establish a reproducible,
wafer-scale route to nonclassical-light generation in integrated photonics and
lay the groundwork for scalable CV processors, multiplexed entanglement
sources, and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Wafer-Scale Squeezed-Light Chips
1 Introduction
Quantum science and technology are emerging as transformative drivers of
innovation across advanced computing [1, 2], sensing [3, 4], and secure communication [5], promising capabilities beyond the reach of classical systems.
At the heart of many of these applications lies the ability to generate, manipulate, and detect non-classical states of light. Among them, squeezed light—in
which quantum fluctuations in one quadrature are suppressed below the
shot-noise limit (SNL) [6]—offers intrinsic quantum advantages in precision
measurements and serves as a key resource for CV quantum information processing protocols [7–10]. Since its first experimental demonstration in 1985 [11],
squeezed light has been extensively explored in bulk optical platforms, achieving record shot-noise suppression exceeding 15 dB [12–14]. Such table-top
systems have enabled landmark achievements, from enhancing the sensitivity
of gravitational-wave detectors (e.g., LIGO) [15, 16] to advancing quantum
imaging of biological structures [17], dual-comb spectroscopy for gas sensing [18, 19], generation of large-scale cluster states [20, 21], and distributed
entangled sensor networks [22–25].
Translating these laboratory demonstrations into deployable quantum
systems requires platforms that maintain high performance while battling
scalability, stability, robust integration, and cost-effectiveness challenges [26].
Photonic integrated circuits fabricated in CMOS-compatible processes provide a compelling route: they offer phase-stable operations, environmental
robustness, and mature process design kits (PDKs) with wafer-scale fabrication control. Recent advances have realized on-chip CV cluster states [27, 28],
broadband homodyne detection integrated with CMOS electronics [29], and
antenna arrays for squeezed light [30]. Across these applications, preserving
strong squeezing is a pivotal requirement to achieve a quantum advantage—
benchmarks for the amount of needed squeezing commonly cited in the field
include at least 3 dB for enabling entanglement swapping [10, 31], 4.5 dB for
two-dimensional cluster-state generation [20], and 10 dB for fault-tolerant CV
quantum computing [32, 33]. However, squeezed light is extreme vulnerable
to loss and noise stemming from practical imperfections due to, e.g., propagation loss incurred along the optical path, phase-locking instability, and the
inefficiencies of optical components such as filters needed to reject the pump.
Over the past decade, chip-scale squeezed-light sources have been investigated across several material platforms—including thin-film lithium niobate
(TFLN) [34–37], Si3N4 [38–43], and silica (SiO2) [27, 44]—each offering distinct
trade-offs in nonlinearity, loss, cost, and process maturity. To deliver reproducible, high-performance squeezing at scale, fully CMOS-compatible PICs
are especially attractive: they leverage established PDKs and foundry workflows while enabling co-integration of the classical, linear photonic units, such
as filters, phase shifters, interferometers, and low-loss delay lines, to complement the quantum components, positioning Si3N4 as a leading candidate to
meet these requirements [45, 46]. A vital, albeit persistently challenging, step

toward manufacturable quantum PICs has been migrating chip-level demonstrations to a wafer-scale production while preserving strong squeezing, as
even modest excess loss and noise can rapidly erode the achievable quantum
advantages in different CV quantum sensing and information processing tasks.
In particular, achieving > 3 dB of measured squeezing is recognized as a first
critical milestone, marking the threshold for bona fide quantum advantages in
CV quantum teleportation [47] and entanglement swapping [31] and deemed
a transition from marginal noise reduction to operationally useful nonclassical
resources for quantum-enhanced tasks.
In this work, we address this challenge by demonstrating wafer-scale fabrication and generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states on a
fully CMOS-compatible Si3N4 PIC platform. We achieve > 3 dB of directly
measured quadrature squeezing uniformly across a 4-inch wafer, with deviceto-device variation < 0.2 dB (2.9-3.1 dB). This reproducible performance is
enabled by a single subtractive fabrication process that co-integrates, for the
first time, ultralow-loss (Qi > 107), dispersion-engineered, strongly overcoupled microresonators (escape efficiency > 91% near 1560 nm), high-extinction
pump-rejection filters (each > 30 dB), and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers (chip–fiber coupling > 75%) on the same chip. By reducing insertion
loss and providing stable thermo-optic control, this system-level integration
converts squeezed-light generation from a device-level demonstration into a
wafer-scale, manufacturable resource for CV quantum photonics. Together
with recent progress in system-level electro-optical co-packaging, our results
establish a new benchmark for reproducible, wafer-scale nonclassical-light
generation in integrated photonics and point toward high-volume CMOS
manufacturing of quantum processing circuits.
2 Design of quantum photonic integrated
circuits
Figure 1a illustrates the schematic of the device architecture for on-chip
squeezed-light generation. A continuous-wave (CW) pump laser, operated
below the parametric oscillation threshold, is coupled into a strongly overcoupled Si3N4 microring resonator. Inside the cavity, the enhanced circulating
pump field drives non-degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) via the χ(3) nonlinearity of the Si3N4 waveguide, in which two pump photons are annihilated
and converted into a pair of correlated signal and idler photons occupying
adjacent resonances, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The emitted signal-idler mode
pairs form a TMSV state, exhibiting quadrature noise suppression of ˆpS + ˆpI
and ˆqS −ˆqI below the shot-noise limit (SNL)—a defining signature of squeezing—while the conjugate quadratures ˆpS −ˆpI and ˆqS + ˆqI display increased
noise fluctuation, i.e., anti-squeezing.
Strong squeezing is essential for CV quantum technologies, as the squeezing level directly determines the degree of quantum advantage attainable in

sensing, communication, and information processing. The maximum achievable squeezing extracted from the resonator is governed by the escape efficiency
[38, 44], defined as η = 1 −QL/Qi, with 1/QL = 1/Qi + 1/Qc, where Qi,
Qc, and QL are the intrinsic, coupling, and loaded quality factors. In principle, high Qi—typically limited by nanofabrication imperfections and material
absorption—together with a moderately low QL is desirable for generating
strong squeezing. Lowering QL increases the η and thus the potential squeezing level, but it also leads to undesired effects such as a higher parametric
oscillation threshold and increased susceptibility to photo-refractive noise from
stronger pump power. In practice, the measured squeezing is limited by all
losses incurred between the squeezing chip and the off-chip photodetectors,
which constitute the dominant imperfection that caps the amount of measured
squeezing level in our experiment. For χ(3)-based nanophotonics squeezed-light
sources, an additional challenge arises because the pump laser lies spectrally
close to the squeezed modes, making efficient pump rejection with minimal
insertion loss a formidable task. To address this, we employ two integrated
add-drop filters with large free spectral range (FSR) placed after the microring resonator that generates squeezed light, namely, the squeezer. These filters
provide high extinction ratios, negligible insertion loss, and broadband resonance tunability, thereby efficiently suppressing residual pump light while
minimizing system loss. Thermo-optic microheaters are integrated on both
the squeezer and the filters for resonance tuning and long-term stabilization.
The filtered squeezed light is then collected through an inverse-tapered waveguide coupler, interfered with a bi-tone local oscillator (LO), and characterized

We fabricate the designed squeezing chips on a 4-inch, 800-nm-thick Si3N4on-SiO2-on-Si wafer (see Methods). Each wafer contains eight dies for TMSV
generation, with each die integrating four squeezed-light photonic circuits
implementing different pump-rejection filter parameters, while the remaining
four dies are reserved for other projects. To benchmark wafer-scale squeezing performance, we generate and characterize TMSV states across all eight
dies following a similar procedure as previous demonstrations (Ref. [44] and

Methods). In our experiment, a CW laser boosted by an erbium-doped fiber
amplifier (EDFA) is used as the pump, with amplified spontaneous emission
(ASE) noise suppressed by a Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH)-locked, 2 MHzlinewidth free-space mode cleaner. The squeezer’s and filters’ resonances are
initially red-detuned and then gradually tuned toward the pump wavelength by
reducing the microheater temperature, thereby stabilizing resonance aligned
with the pump. The generated TMSV signal is collected at the through port.
A phase-coherent LO is derived from the same CW pump by driving a fiber
electro-optic modulator (EOM) to generate an EO comb followed by a programmable filter used to select bi-tone comb teeth frequency-matched to the
two TMSV modes. Finally, the squeezed light and the LO are interfered on
a 50:50 beam splitter and detected with a homemade BHD to measure the
quadrature noise variances.
Figure 2a shows a photograph of the fabricated 4-inch Si3N4 squeezed-light
wafer, with insets labeling the directly measured maximum squeezing level
of each die. The corresponding quadrature noise-variance spectra, normalized
to the calibrated shot-noise level, are shown in Fig. 2b. Four dies exceed or
reach 3.0 dB of squeezing, with the highest level measured at 3.1 dB and the
lowest at 2.9 dB. Across the wafer, the squeezing levels range from 2.9 to 3.1
dB, yielding an average of 2.96 ± 0.2 dB, demonstrating excellent wafer-scale
reproducibility and uniformity.
Fig. 2c shows a photograph of a Si3N4 squeezing die wire-bonded to a customized printed circuit board (PCB) for thermo-optic resonance tuning and
locking. Low-loss edge coupling is achieved using lensed fibers and inversetapered waveguides. Optical micrographs of the core functional elements of
the Si3N4 squeezing chip are presented in Fig. 2d. The on-chip squeezer consists of a racetrack microring resonator composed of two modified Euler bends
connected by straight sections. The resonator is side-coupled to a bus waveguide of identical cross-sectional geometry, which ensures inherent broadband
phase matching and excitation of the low-loss, fundamental waveguide modes.
A trade-off between minimizing intrinsic scattering loss (high Qi), achieving strong bus-to-resonator coupling (low Qc and QL), maintaining near-zero
anomalous dispersion, and suppressing mode coupling is realized with a waveguide cross section of 2600 nm × 800 nm and optimized Euler curvature. The
total cavity length is approximately 2425 µm, corresponding to an FSR of
about 59.3 GHz. To reject the strong residual pump, the output is passed
through two cascaded add-drop microring filters, each of which employs a 1500
nm × 800 nm waveguide cross section with optimized Euler bends. The two
bus-to-resonator couplings are optimized such that the coupling loss dominates the intrinsic loss, placing the filters near the critical-coupling regime and
rendering the extinction ratio robust against nanofabrication-induced variations or input-power–dependent material absorption. Their FSR (∼603 GHz)
is engineered to minimize the impact on the squeezing modes. The drop ports
provide power-monitoring signals for active resonance locking via thermo-optic
detuning. Deep thermal isolation trenches are introduced around the filters to

suppress thermal crosstalk with the squeezer. Finally, the filtered TMSV light
is edge-coupled out through a 300 µm-long inverse-tapered waveguide with a
tip dimension of 220 nm × 800 nm, exhibiting good mode matching with a 5
µm-diameter lensed fiber to achieve low coupling loss.

(signal), 1560.0 nm (pump), and 1560.5 nm (idler) are selected for subsequent
TMSV generation. Resonance fitting in Fig. 3b reveals a loaded quality factor
of QL ∼0.83×106 together with a high intrinsic quality factors Qi ∼10.1×106
that yield a large field escape efficiency exceeding η > 91%, enabling the
generation of strong on-chip squeezing, while the relatively high QL allows
operation at moderate pump power levels to mitigate parasitic effects such as
photorefractive noise. To assess wafer-scale uniformity, we extract the statistical distributions of Qi, QL, and η across resonances in the 1550–1580 nm
range, as shown in Figs. 3(c–e). The most probable values for the quality factors are Qi = 9.2×106 and QL = 0.9×106, demonstrating uniform low optical
loss and reliable strong bus-to-resonator coupling across the wafer. Combining
Qi and QL infers the most probable η ≈91%, corresponding to a maximum
achievable on-chip squeezing level as high as 10.5 dB. Notably, even the lowest
η ≈75% in Fig. 3(e) promises an achievable on-chip squeezing level exceeding
6.0 dB. Moreover, the reduced material absorption and scattering at longer
wavelengths are expected to yield even higher Qi’s and lower QL’s, leading to
stronger η.
We design the pump rejection filters with a relatively broad linewidth
of ∼26 pm (corresponding to QL ∼6 × 104), which reduces intracavity
power buildup, mitigates thermo-optic instabilities, and increases tolerance
to resonance drift. Moreover, because coupling losses dominate over intrinsic
losses, the high extinction ratios (measured ranging from 30 to 40 dB) remain
robust during squeezing measurement under high input powers and various
wavelength range (see Supplemental Information). In addition, the edge couplers provide a reliable waveguide-to-fiber efficiency of ∼75% across the wafer
(see Supplemental Information), with further improvements possible through
anti-reflection coatings to suppress facet reflections. Collectively, these classical characterizations validate the key requirements for the measured high
squeezing across the 4-inch Si3N4 wafer: large escape efficiencies with highQ resonances, efficient and power-stable pump rejection, and low-loss fiber
interfacing.
3.2 On-chip squeezing-light generation: Models and
characterization
The mechanism of on-chip squeezed-light generation via non-degenerate fourwave mixing (FWM) was established in Refs. [48, 49]. Following this approach,
we provide a theoretical study of the squeezing performance attainable under
different dispersion regimes, explicitly incorporating experimentally determined device parameters and losses. The interactions among cavity modes are

Equation (4) indicates that each mode l is coupled exclusively with its symmetric partner −l, and different pairs evolve independently. The pump dynamics
are governed mainly by self-phase modulation, while the side modes are driven
through cross-phase modulation and FWM. Solving these coupled equations
provides access to the quadrature variances of the resulting two-mode squeezed
vacuum states.
Fig. 4a shows the measured quadrature noise variance of the squeezed light,
normalized to this shot-noise reference. By periodically scanning the LO phase,
we access all quadratures of the TMSV state. A raw squeezing level of 3.0 dB
and an anti-squeezing level of 6.0 dB are directly observed at an on-chip pump
power of 50 mW. Fig. 4b presents the measured maximum squeezing and antisqueezing levels as a function of on-chip pump power, all remaining below the
parametric oscillation threshold. As expected, both the squeezing and antisqueezing levels increase with pump power. Beyond the optimal pump power,

however, the observed squeezing slightly degrades as excess variance in the
anti-squeezing quadrature mixes into the squeezing quadrature. The experimental data agree well with theoretical predictions depicted as dashed lines
in Fig. 4b based on a model that incorporates the measured device parameters (Methods). Given the large escape efficiency of the squeezer (∼91%),
the observed squeezing is primarily limited by the total collection efficiency
of ∼60% after generation, comprising a waveguide-to-fiber coupling efficiency
of 75%, propagation efficiency of 95% through fiber and free-space optics,
interference visibility of 98%, and photodiode quantum efficiency of 88%. Compared with our previous TMSV demonstration employing off-chip pump filters,
this integrated design yields an improvement of more than 2 dB in measured
squeezing by virtue of the ultra-low-loss integrated filters and their enabled
removal of isolators. Notably, the strong quadrature squeezing is not restricted
to nearest modes adjacent to the pump as the non-degenerate FWM process supports concurrent generation of broadband squeezing across multiple
mode pairs known as quantum microcomb [44]. Such broadband squeezing
modes could be accessed either by cascading EOMs and function generators
to synthesize matched LOs, or by employing coherent optical soliton microcombs realized on the same 800-nm, anomalous-dispersion Si3N4 platform to
overcome the bandwidth limitations of EO combs [48].
4 Discussion and Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated wafer-scale, fully CMOS-compatible Si3N4
PICs for the generation of TMSV states, achieving a maximum (minimum)
measured quadrature squeezing of 3.1 dB (2.9 dB) across an entire 4-inch
wafer, evidencing highly uniform, robust performance. This reproducibility
arises from the co-integration of ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled microring

squeezers, high-extinction pump rejection filters, low-loss edge couplers, and
thermo-optic tuning on the same chip. The experimental results are in quantitative agreement with theoretical modeling based on independently extracted
device parameters. The observed squeezing is currently limited by an overall
off-chip detection efficiency of ∼60%, pointing to a clear pathway toward further improvement through reducing extrinsic losses associated with, e.g., the
fiber–chip interfaces and photodetector. In addition to the strong squeezing,
the Si3N4 platform endows additional functionalities that are out of reach in
a table-top or single integrated component platform, such as reconfigurable
interferometers [50], long delay lines for time-domain cluster-state generation [20, 21], and co-integration with modulators and detectors [51, 52]. Such
capabilities point toward a future where entire continuous-variable quantum
processors can be realized on a single CMOS-compatible photonic chip, bridging the gap between laboratory-scale demonstrations and scalable quantum
technologies.

Methods
Device fabrication process.
The complete wafer-scale fabrication of the
Si3N4 squeezed-light chips [53] is performed using an amorphous silicon (aSi) hardmask dry etching process in the University of Michigan’s Lurie
Nanofabrication Facility. A detailed fabrication flow is shown in Supplementary Information. The fabrication begins with the growth of a 3000-nm-thick
wet thermal SiO2 layer on a 4-inch bare Si substrate, followed by the deposition of a 380-nm low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) Si3N4
film. Crack-isolation trenches are defined along the wafer boundary using photolithography and inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE),
etching through both the Si3N4 and the underlying SiO2 layer. After photoresist removal and thorough wafer cleaning, a second 420-nm LPCVD Si3N4
layer is deposited, resulting in a final Si3N4 thickness of approximately 800 nm.
The combined bilayer structure is dispersion-engineered to exhibit anomalous
group velocity dispersion. On-chip structures are defined in eight die regions
across the wafer using electron-beam lithography (JEOL 6300) with maN-2405
resist. The patterns are transferred into the a-Si hardmask layer via ICP-RIE
(LAM 9400) using a HBr/He chemistry. The underlying 800-nm Si3N4 film is
then fully etched using a separate ICP-RIE system (STS APS DGRIE) with
a gas mixture of C4F8, CF4, and He. The residual a-Si hardmask is removed
using isotropic XeF2 etching (Xactix). After completely etching the backside
Si3N4 layer, the wafer undergoes Piranha and standard RCA cleaning, followed
by high-temperature annealing in N2 at 1100◦C for 6 hours. To complete the
waveguide cladding, an 800-nm LPCVD TEOS oxide layer is first deposited,
followed by a 2200-nm plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)
SiO2 layer and another 6-hour N2 annealing at 1100◦C. Microheaters are fabricated by depositing 5-nm Ti and 250-nm Pt films onto the SiO2 cladding
surface using UV stepper photolithography (GCA AS200) alignment with
LOR/S1813 resist, electron-beam evaporation, and a regular lift-off process
with Remover PG and IPA. To form the edge couplers, taper structures are

exposed by UV stepper photolithography with AZ 12-XT, followed by full ICPRIE etching of both the PECVD SiO2 cladding and the buried SiO2 layer. For
chip release, the 250-µm-thick Si substrate is ICP-RIE etched using the Bosch
deep silicon etching process (STS Pegasus) with alternating cycles of SF6,
C4F8, and O2 gases. The wafer is then diced into individual chips for classical
characterization. Finally, each chip is wire-bonded (MPP iBond 5000) to a custom PCB circuit to enable thermal tuning of the on-chip microheater elements
with external multi-channel current sources for squeezing measurement.
Classical characterization.
A tunable CW laser (Santec TSL-770) is
passed through a fiber polarization controller and coupled into the bus waveguide of the Si3N4 squeezing chip using a lensed fiber. The laser wavelength
is swept at 20 nm/s and the transmitted light through the squeezer and
integrated filters is collected by another lensed fiber and detected with a lownoise photodetector (NewFocus 1811). The on-chip optical power is maintained
below 20 µW to avoid thermal effects. The transmission spectra are recorded
on an oscilloscope and analyzed using custom Python scripts to extract the
coupling and intrinsic quality factors (Qc and Qi) of the target resonances via
Lorentzian fitting.
Quantum characterization.
A low-noise tunable CW laser (TLB-6700) is
amplified by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and subsequently filtered by a free-space, narrow-linewidth (∼2 MHz) mode cleaner to suppress
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. The output light is then split
into two paths: one serves as pump for the Si3N4 photonic chip to generate
the TMSV states, while the other is used for preparing the LO for balanced
homodyne detection of the generated squeezed light.
In the Si3N4 squeezing chip path, the light passes through two polarization controllers to excite the TE00 bus waveguide mode. To align the target
squeezing resonance with the pump laser, the microring is first initialized
at an elevated temperature, shifting its resonance to longer wavelengths. By
gradually reducing the microheater temperature, the cavity resonance is blueshifted to align with the pump light for efficient squeezing generation. Below
the parametric oscillation threshold, TMSV states are generated and escape
the squeezer together with residual pump light. The unwanted pump is filtered by the two filters aligned with the pump wavelength. We monitor the
power at the two drop ports for actively feedback control of the microheaters.
Each filter achieves 30-40 dB of filtering efficiency, rendering a single filter
adequate to reduce the residual pump power below 50 µW in most cases. The
insertion loss is negligible owing to the straight bus waveguide. The deep thermal isolation trenches effectively eliminate thermal crosstalk, ensuring stable
and reproducible operation of the filters without affecting the squeezer. The
squeezed light is subsequently collected by a lensed fiber and launched into a
free-space path for homodyne measurement.
In the LO path, the pump light is sent through a fiber EOM (EOspace)
driven by a radio frequency (RF) function generator. A modulation frequency
close to fm ∼19.77 GHz is chosen such that the generated third-order sideband

aligns with the free spectral range of the squeezer (3fm ∼FSR). The desired
LO sideband tooth is filtered using a programmable waveshaper (Finisar) with
a specified extinction ratio exceeding 60 dB. During the experiment, fm is fine
tuned to achieve the maximum amount of squeezing. The LO, with optical
power of approximately 5 mW, is then combined with the two-mode squeezed
light on a 50:50 beam splitter, and the outputs are detected with a pair photodiodes operating in a balanced configuration. The difference photocurrent is
then analyzed on an electrical spectrum analyzer (ESA) at a central frequency
of 7 MHz, resolution bandwidth (RBW) of 300 kHz, and video bandwidth
(VBW) of 470 Hz. The common-mode rejection ratio of the balanced detectors is measured to be ∼40 dB, allowing the homodyne detection to operation
in the shot-noise-limited regime calibrated by injecting only the LO into the
balanced photodiodes.
Model for on-chip squeezed-light generation.
To formulate a quantumoptical model of squeezed-light generation, we start with a semiclassical picture
prior to canonical quantization. The classical coupled-mode relation is

Al−iD2
2 l2Al+δ(l, 0)√κeAin+ig0

nAp.
(5)
Here, Al is the amplitude of the l-th mode with respect to the pump, normalized so that |Al|2 represents photon flux. The resonance linewidth κ captures
both the intrinsic loss κi and coupling loss κe. The pump detuning is ∆, the
dispersion is quantified by D2, and the nonlinear coefficient g0 gives the perphoton frequency shift from four-wave mixing. We assume perfect overlap of
the azimuthal modes. Eq. (5) therefore models the dynamics and coupling of
cavity modes, laying the groundwork for analyzing two-mode squeezing. Following Ref. [49], canonical quantization is carried out by promoting A and A∗
to operators ˆA and ˆA†, in conjuction with adding vacuum noise operators ˆV
for each loss channel to ensure the commutation relation persists, giving rise
to the quantum version of the coupled-mode equations:

(6)
Operating below the optical parametric oscillation threshold, only the pumped
mode acquires a mean field, while all other modes only exhibit quantum
fluctuations. Thus, the operators can be linearized as
( ˆ
A0 = A0 + ˆa0(t)
ˆAl = ˆal(t), l ̸= 0.

These equations can equivalently be obtained from the Hamiltonian in the
Heisenberg picture [49]. Nonlinear terms show that the pump is only governed
by self-phase modulation, while sideband fluctuations arise through both crossphase modulation and four-wave mixing. Importantly, each pair of l and −l
modes is coupled but independent of other pairs.
We now transform into the frequency domain. The output operator for
mode l reads
ˆ˜Aout,l(ω) = √κe ˆ˜Al(ω) −ˆ˜Ve,l(ω),
(10)
with the vacuum operators obeying the following correlations:
⟨ˆ˜Vt,l(ω) ˆ˜V †
t′,l′(ω′)⟩= δt,t′δl,l′δ(ω −ω′)
⟨ˆ˜V †
t,l(ω) ˆ˜Vt′,l′(ω′)⟩= 0
⟨ˆ˜Vt,l(ω) ˆ˜Vt′,l′(ω′)⟩= ⟨ˆ˜V †
t,l(ω) ˆ˜V †
t′,l′(ω′)⟩= 0; t = i, e.
(11)
Solving Eq. (9) allows one to extract the fluctuation spectra and thereby the
squeezing spectrum for the l and −l modes.
To account for detection, all losses are combined into an overall quantum
efficiency ηtotal, so the measured operator is
ˆ˜Ameas,l = √ηtotal ˆ˜Aout,l +
p
1 −ηtotal ˆ˜Vη
(12)
where ˆ˜Ameas,l is the detected operator, and ˆVη represents additional vacuum
noise.
Finally, in balanced homodyne detection, the LO carries components at
±l. Introducing rotated quadratures for LO with phase θ:
ˆ˜ql(ω; θ) = ˆ˜ql(ω) cos θ −ˆ˜pl(ω) sin θ,
ˆ˜pl(ω; θ) = ˆ˜ql(ω) sin θ + ˆ˜pl(ω) cos θ,
