Abstract.
The controlled generation of non-classical states of light is a challenging
task at the heart of quantum optics. Aside from the mere spirit of science, the related
research is strongly driven by applications in photonic quantum technologies, including
the ﬁelds of quantum communication, quantum computation, and quantum metrology.
In this context, the realization of integrated solid-state-based quantum-light sources is
of particular interest, due to the prospects for scalability and device integration.
This topical review focuses on solid-state quantum-light sources which are
fabricated in a deterministic fashion. In this framework we cover quantum emitters
represented by semiconductor quantum dots, colour centres in diamond, and defect-
/strain-centres in two-dimensional materials. First, we introduce the topic of quantumlight sources and non-classical light generation for applications in photonic quantum
technologies, motivating the need for the development of scalable device technologies
to push the ﬁeld to real-world applications.
In the second part, we summarize
material systems hosting quantum emitters in the solid-state. The third part reviews
deterministic fabrication techniques and comparatively discusses their advantages and
disadvantages.
The techniques are classiﬁed in bottom-up approaches, exploiting
the site-controlled positioning of the quantum emitters themselves, and top-down
approaches, allowing for the precise alignment of photonic microstructures to preselected quantum emitters.
Special emphasis is put on the progress achieved in
the development of in-situ techniques, which signiﬁcantly pushed the performance
of quantum-light sources towards applications.
Additionally we discuss hybrid
approaches, exploiting pick-and-place techniques or wafer-bonding. The fourth part
presents state-of-the-art quantum-dot quantum-light sources based on the fabrication
techniques presented in the previous sections, which feature engineered functionality
and enhanced photon collection eﬃciency. The article closes by highlighting recent
applications of deterministic solid-state-based quantum-light sources in the ﬁelds
of quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum metrology, and
discussing future perspectives in the ﬁeld of solid-state quantum-light sources.

1. Introduction
Light sources capable for the generation of non-classical states of light are at the heart
of many applications in photonic quantum technologies [1]. Many schemes of quantum
communication and cryptography [2, 3, 4, 5], for instance, rely on the availability of
streams of single photons or entangled photon pairs on demand. The desired quantum
light states are thereby often required to meet speciﬁc properties regarding the photons’
wavelength, coherence time, indistinguishability, or polarization.
Examples include
quantum key distribution [6] as well as quantum repeaters protocols [7, 8]. Due to the
prospects for device integration and scalability, engineered solid-state-based quantumlight sources are of particular interest.
The respective quantum emitters, however,
diﬀer in their optoelectronic properties within and across given ensembles, due to
statistical variations in size, geometry, and material composition or simply the solid-state
hostmaterial itself. To engineer quantum devices with the required optical properties,
deterministic fabrication techniques are in great demand, enabling a higher degree of
control for the parameters relevant for their targeted applications.
This topical review focuses on solid-state quantum-light sources which are
fabricated in a deterministic fashion using advanced nanotechnology platforms.
In
section 2 we ﬁrst introduce diﬀerent types of material systems hosting quantum emitters
in the solid-state.
Section 3 reviews the techniques used for deterministic device
fabrication.
The respective approaches are grouped in four categories: (1) Bottomup techniques for the site-controlled growth or deﬁnition of quantum emitters (cf.
section 3.1). (2) Top-down marker-based techniques for the device fabrication around
pre-selected, self-organized and stochastically-grown quantum emitters (cf. section 3.2).
(3) In-situ techniques, where the emitter selection or deﬁnition and the lithography of
a device is achieved in the same machine at low temperatures (cf. section 3.3). (4)
Hybrid approaches, combining diﬀerent techniques from (1) to (3) (cf. section 3.4).
In section 4 state-of-the-art solid-state quantum-light sources based on the fabrication
techniques presented in the previous sections are presented with a focus on quantum
dot devices. Here, emphasis is put on an engineered functionality, enhanced photon
collection eﬃciency, and recent developments such as the modularization in plug-andplay devices. The article closes with section 5 by highlighting recent applications of
deterministic solid-state-based quantum-light sources in photonic quantum technologies
and discussing future perspectives in this context.

quantum-light sources.

2.1. Epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots
Since their discovery in the early 1990s [14, 15] epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots
(QDs) have had an impressive career and rouse prospects for novel applications in various
ﬁelds of research reaching from semiconductor laser physics [16] to quantum information
processing [17, 18].
QDs are crystalline clusters of a few hundreds to thousands of atoms embedded
in a semiconductor matrix (see ﬁgure 1(a)).
The QD islands can form in a selforganized fashion during the epitaxy of single monolayers of two materials with diﬀerent
lattice constants.
Diﬀerent types of growth regimes are distinguished depending on
the materials and the growth conditions (temperature, pressure, amount of material,
growth interruption, etc.) [19]. Typically, the energy band gap of the QD material is
chosen to be smaller as compared to the surrounding matrix material, which leads to a
three-dimensional conﬁnement potential for electrons and holes in the conduction band
and valence band, respectively [20]. The growth of QDs can be conducted either via
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
Both methods enable monolayer deposition with high precision. In MOCVD reactant
gases are fed into the reactor at a typical pressure of 15 to 750 Torr, whereas MBE

requires ultra-high vacuum conditions (pressures < 10−8 Torr) during the epitaxy of
the semiconductor material obtained from heated eﬀusion cells [21].
While MBE is
mostly used in research laboratories and enables lowest impurity levels, MOCVD is
also employed for large scale production due to its lower costs. The internal atomic
structure of a QD embedded in bulk material is resolved by cross-sectional scanning
tunneling microscopy (XSTM) in Figure 1 (a) [9].
The conﬁnement potential of QDs with lateral dimensions on the order of the
de Broglie wavelength of electrons and holes leads to quantized energy levels of the
conﬁned charge carriers and, hence, to a discrete emission spectrum in photo- or
electroluminescence experiments. Especially at low temperatures, phonon-coupling is
almost negligible [22, 23, 24], which leads to predominant emission into the zero-phonon
line (ZPL), in contrast to colour centres (cf. 2.2). Besides the fundamental excitonic
state X, constituted of a single electron and a single hole, various multiparticle states can
form inside a single QD, typically leading to a variety of emission lines. Two electronhole pairs captured inside a QD, for instance, form a biexciton (XX) state, while uneven
numbers of charge-carriers for electrons and holes result in positively or negatively
charged multi-particle states [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Spectrally selecting the emission of
one speciﬁc state results in the distillation of single photons leaving the QD one by
one. This leads to the famous antibunching eﬀect in photon statistics measurements
via a Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) setup [30]. Recently, a record-low antibunching
value of g(2)(0) = (7.5 ± 1.6) × 10−5 has been reported using QD single-photon sources
[31]. Beyond the possibility of generating single-photon states, QDs also allow for the
generation of temporally-correlated photon pairs [32, 33, 34] via the biexciton-exciton
(XX-X) radiative cascade [35]. As mentioned above, the XX state of a QD is constituted
of two bound electron-hole pairs. Owing to quantum mechanical Coulomb interactions
of the involved charge carriers [36], this state typically shows a ﬁnite binding energy
EXX
bin with respect to the case of two unbound excitons, which is on the order of 1 meV
in case of the InGaAs/GaAs material system [27].
The exciton state, on the other
hand, consists of a single electron-hole pair and usually reveals a ﬁne-structure splitting
∆EFSS on the order of 10 µeV [25], which arises from anisotropic electron-hole exchange
interaction.
The resulting radiative cascade emits pairs of photons in two possible
decay channels, one being linear-horizontally (H) and the other one linear-vertically (V)
polarized. Exploiting speciﬁc symmetry properties of QDs, this XX-X radiative cascade
can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs [37, 38] or so-called twin-photon states
[39, 40] (see section 4.2). For applications in photonic quantum technologies QDs are
particular interesting, as they can be embedded straightforwardly in diode structures
enabling electrical operation of the emitters [41, 42]. Moreover, the radiative lifetime of
QDs is relatively short (≈1 ns, Ref. [43] and references therein), enabling high photon
generation rates.
The stochastic nature of the self-organized growth of QDs, however, leads to
an inhomogeneous broadening of the emission properties of ensembles of emitters.
Therefore, various measures have been developed to inﬂuence the QD emission

wavelength. Using partial capping and annealing during the QD growth [44, 45, 46]
or post-growth rapid thermal annealing [47, 29, 48, 49] the emission wavelength and
other properties, such as the ﬁne-structure splitting, of QDs can be adjusted to a certain
extent at the ensemble level. Still these techniques are only workarounds towards fully
deterministic and scalable technology platforms, which will be the central subject of
this review article.
2.2. Colour centres in crystals
Another promising type of quantum emitters are colour or defect centres in bulk or
nano crystals. colour centres are crystallographic point defects, where a single native
atom of the lattice is substituted by an impurity (see ﬁgure 1(b)). This conﬁguration
leads to discrete electronic states deep inside the energy bandgap of the host crystal,
often resulting in a high temperature stability up to room temperature [50]. Prominent
examples are nitrogen-vacancies (NV) or silicon-vacancies (SiV) in diamond crystals,
which are to date among the most thoroughly studied colour centres (see Refs. [10, 51]
for a review).
NV and SiV centres naturally occur in diamond, but can also be
produced deterministically, which will be discussed in section 3.3. Compared to QDs,
the coupling to phonons is relatively strong.
The SiV centre in diamond, however,
also provides strong emission into the zero phonon line (ZPL) of about 70% at room
temperature and additionally enables the fabrication of emitter ensembles with ultrasmall inhomogeneous broadening [52]. More recently also germanium-vacancy (GeV)
or tin-vacancy (SnV) color centres in diamond are considered to enable single-photon
sources with improved quantum eﬃciencies [53].
Compared to QDs, the radiative
lifetimes of defect centres in diamond are long-lived (≈10 ns, Ref. [43] and references
therein), leading to reduced photon generation rates.
Beyond the diamond material platform,
large progress has been achieved
with colour centres in compound semiconductors.
Silicon carbide (SiC) with
embedded positively charged carbon antisite-vacancies (CVCSi) can be used to develop
room-temperature single-photon sources [54].
Another wide-bandgap compound
semiconductor with potential for the engineering of quantum light emitting devices
is ZnO. With respect to the hosted colour centres, however, this material system is
far less understood and the quantum emitters suﬀer from reduced optical quality as
compared to the material systems discussed above [55]. Additionally, the fabrication of
high-quality diode structures has not been successful to date, hindering the realization of
electrically controlled devices so far [43]. Other candidates for single-photon generation
in the solid-state are rare-earth-ion impurities in crystals such as yttrium aluminum
garnet (YAG) and yttrium orthosilicate (YOS) [56, 57]. Radiative lifetimes of colour
centres in compound semiconductors (SiC, ZnO, etc.) and rare-earth impurities in YAG
crystals are in between those of QDs and colour centres in diamond (≈1−4 ns, Ref. [43]
and references therein).
More generally, the realization of integrated devices based on colour centres is

very demanding, and electrical pumping of the quantum emitters has been impossible
for a long time. For the diamond and SiC material system, this challenge has been
mastered meanwhile, and single-photon emitting diodes operating at room-temperature
were demonstrated [58, 59].
2.3. Two-dimensional materials
There exists a plethora of quasi two-dimensional (2D) materials, which can be obtained
by exfoliation from bulk materials that are composed of stacks of weakly interacting
atomically thin layers. The most prominent example for such a van-der-Waals material
comprises a sheet of carbon atoms aligned in a hexagonal lattice - also known as
graphene. ’Rolled up’ forming a carbon nanotube (see ﬁgure 1(c)), graphene has been
used to demonstrate antibunching in photoluminescence experiments [60]. Very recently,
carefully synthesized triangular ﬂakes of graphene, referred to as graphene QDs, have
been used for single-photon generation at room temperature [61].
With respect to quantum light generation, recently also another type of 2D material
system attracted great interest: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) [62, 63].
TMDCs are a class of materials with the formula MX2, where M is a transition
metal element (group IV, V or VI), and X is a chalcogen (see ﬁgure 1(d)).
One
of the intriguing properties of TMDCs are their layer-dependent optical properties.
Several TMDC semiconductors, for instance molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2) and tungsten
diselenide (WSe2), show a transition from an indirect bandgap in bulk to a direct
bandgap in the monolayer conﬁguration [64, 65]. In 2015 ﬁve groups independently
reported the observation of single-photon emission by localized luminescence centres in
WSe2 [66, 67, 68, 69, 13]. Moreover, signatures of the XX-X radiative cascade were
observed [70, 71], rising prospects for the generation of entangled photon pairs in 2D
material systems. The origin of these emitters is attributed to excitons bound by shallow
conﬁnement potentials generated by local strain ﬂuctuations. For this reason, TMDCbased quantum emitters to date operate only at cryogenic temperatures and are highly
susceptible to spectral diﬀusion [13].
In contrast, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) oﬀer superior
temperature stability, as the associated defect states are located deep inside the energy
bandgap, similarly to colour centres in diamond. Therefore, single-photon emission is
stable up to room temperature [72, 73] and even far beyond [74].
Radiative lifetimes of quantum emitters in 2D materials are similar to those of
QDs (cf. Ref. [43] and references therein). The emission, however, often suﬀers from
pronounced spectral diﬀusion, which complicates quantum optics experiments. To date,
for example, there is only a single report on resonant laser excitation spectroscopy of
quantum emitters in non-deterministically fabricated 2D materials [75]. The diﬃculty
of resonantly exciting quantum emitters in 2D materials in turn might be one reason
why the generation of indistinguishable photons has not been demonstrated for this
material system yet.

3. Deterministic fabrication techniques
For the scalable fabrication of quantum devices with high yield and optimal performance,
deterministic fabrication techniques are required. The development and the ongoing
improvement of such techniques is therefore one major driving force in the ﬁeld of
photonic quantum technologies. In this section, we introduce prominent approaches
for embedding single quantum emitters in photonic devices using bottom-up or topdown techniques, where emphasize is put on recent technological developments.
In
section 3.1 the site-controlled growth or deﬁnition of quantum emitters will be reviewed.
Marker-based approaches for deterministic device fabrication are discussed in section
3.2). Section 3.3 focuses on in-situ techniques - approaches which are particularly in
vogue today. Last but not least, section 3.4 presents hybrid deterministic approaches
based on multiple material systems.
3.1. Site-controlled quantum emitters (bottom-up)
To achieve the highest degree of scalability in quantum device fabrication, ideally the
quantum emitter itself needs to be positioned precisely at a pre-deﬁned location. In this
section we will summarize such bottom-up approaches for QDs as well as for emerging
2D materials (see ﬁgure 2). One method for achieving position-control for single QDs
is the deposition of QD material on a pre-patterned substrate with or without an
additional buﬀer layer [82].
Using electron-beam lithography (EBL) in combination
with dry etching, pits or nano-holes can be deﬁned in the substrate. Overgrowth of
this patterned substrate with QD material leads to a site-selective growth of QDs. As
an prominent example for this approach Hartmann et al. demonstrated the growth of
GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures in inverted tetrahedral pyramids [83, 77]. In this case,
hexagonal arrays of pits are etched into undoped (111)-B oriented GaAs substrate. In a
next step Al0.45Ga0.55As/GaAs/Al0.45Ga0.55As single quantum well layer sequences are
deposited via MOCVD. This growth conﬁguration leads to the formation of inverted
pyramids, where quantum wires and quantum wells develop at the pyramid corners and
facets, while a single GaAs QD is formed at the sharp pyramid tip. The resulting QDs
feature a precise position control (< 10 nm), small inhomogeneous broadening of the
ensemble emission (< 10 meV) as compared to standard self-organized QDs (typically
30-60 meV [14, 15]), and can be adjusted in their emission wavelength [77]. Due to the
high degree of symmetry present in this approach, site-controlled pyramidal QDs show
small ﬁne-structure splittings < 20 µeV [84], which has been exploited for the generation
of polarization-entangled photon pairs (cf. 4.3 and 4.2). Another example to achieve
site-controlled growth of QDs by using pre-patterened substrates was demonstrated by
Schneider et al. [76]. Here, circular nano-holes with a diameter of 30 nm are deﬁned on
(100) oriented GaAs substrate using electron-cyclotron-resonance reactive-ion or wetchemical etching. In a next step, the nanohole surface is smoothed by a 12 nm thick
GaAs layer before the growth of InAs QDs and a 50 nm thick capping layer is performed
using MBE. Using this process, a standard deviation of the QD position of 50 nm relative

to the target location has been reported. This approach can be used to produce ordered
arrays of single QDs with pitches between 200 nm and 10 µm [85, 86], being beneﬁcial
for device integration. Introducing one or multiple separation layers between the nanoholes and the QD layer, the optical quality of this type of site-controlled QDs can
be improved [87], which otherwise suﬀer from large spectral linewidth due to spectral
diﬀusion caused by the nearby etched surfaces [88]. Employing such reﬁned approaches,
J¨ons et al. demonstrated the triggered generation of indistinguishable photons emitted
by site-controlled QDs [89].
Pre-patterned substrates can also be used to achieve site-controlled growth of
photonic nanowires with integrated single quantum emitters. In their work, Heinrich et
al. demonstrated the positioned growth of AlGaAs nanowires containing an axial GaAs
QD using solid-source MBE in the vapor liquid solid mode [79]. This approach resulted
in tapered nanowires with an average diameter of 167 nm and 304 nm at the top and
the bottom of the nanowire, respectively, and an average nanowire length of 2.6 µm.
A spectral linewidth of 95 µeV and photon antibunching were observed with moderate
single-photon purity (g(2)(0) = 0.46) due to uncorrelated background emission from the
doped GaAs substrate.
Another method for achieving high degrees of position control is based on a buried
stressor consisting of an oxide aperture. Strittmatter et al. demonstrated, that buried

===== Page 10 =====

oxide apertures generate a strain ﬁeld at the surface of a GaAs buﬀer layer, which leads
to the nucleation of QDs above the edges of the aperture. Reducing the aperture size, the
strain-ﬁeld can be ideally focused down to a small region, leading to the strain induced
nucleation of a single site-controlled QD [78, 90]. A particular appealing feature of this
approach is, that the position control of a quantum emitter can be combined with an
optical as well as an electrical conﬁnement generated via the oxide aperture [91], which
is beneﬁcial for the development of eﬃcient deterministically-fabricated and electricallydriven devices (see section 4.3).
A completely diﬀerent approach is used for achieving site-control of quantum
emitters in 2D materials. In two-dimensional sheets of material exfoliated on planar
surfaces, spatially localized quantum emitters with photon antibunching have been
observed (cf.
section 2.3).
The origin of the underlying emission process was still
under debate, but the associated localized luminescence occurred mostly at the edges
of ﬂakes and could also be induced by scratching the material [13]. In 2015 Kumar
et al.
showed, that localization of quantum emitters can be generated by straining
mono- and bilayer WSe2 by patterned substrates [92]. In another approach Kern et al.
demonstrated the nanoscale positioning of quantum emitters in a WSe2 ﬂake, covering
a nanoscale gap between two gold nanorods thus resulting in a strain ﬁeld [80]. Shortly
after, the realization of ordered arrays of quantum emitters was reported using WSe2
ﬂakes covering a substrate with nanopillars [81, 93]. Additionally, also nanobubbles
have been used to induce quantum emitters in WSe2 and BN/WSe2 heterostructures
[94].
The bottom up approaches presented in this section proved their potential for the
scalable fabrication of quantum-light sources. The quantum optical properties of the
respective QDs, however, often do not reach the excellent level of stochastically-grown
self-organized QDs.
One possible reason for the reduced optical quality is that the
subjacent patterned substrate used to achieve site-control introduces defects close to
the QDs.
Additionally, the degree of control achievable for the emitter properties
(e.g.
emission wavelength, inhomogeneous broadening, etc.)
to date is still not
suﬃcient for many applications in quantum information technologies. These drawbacks
are circumvented by top-down approaches presented in the following section. These
drawbacks are circumvented by top-down approaches presented in the following section.
3.2. Marker-based approaches (top-down)
In top-down marker-based approaches, speciﬁc quantum emitters are pre-selected on
the basis of their key emission properties and subsequently integrated into a photonic
device. During a ﬁrst step, suitable quantum emitters are located precisely relative to the
markers deﬁned onto the surface of the target sample. In the second step, the photonic
structure is deﬁned lithographically directly at the position of the quantum emitter.
Seminal experiments using marker-based deterministic technologies are summarized
in Figure 3.
In 2005 Badolato et al.
demonstrated the deterministic coupling of a

stochastically grown InAs/GaAs QD to the cavity mode of a photonic crystal cavity
(PhC) with a Q-factor of about 3000 [95]. To be able to spatially detect the target QD
buried in the unprocessed sample, six vertically strain-correlated QD layers were grown
above the spectrally blue-detuned target quantum emitter. The uppermost QD could
be resolved in SEM images relative to gold markers, which was then used to deﬁne the
spatially aligned PhC via EBL. This deterministic device enabled the observation of
the Purcell eﬀect [98, 99] in the weak coupling regime. A reﬁned method of the same
group enabled two years later the observation of a deterministically-fabricated stronglycoupled QD-cavity system [96]. This was achieved by fabricating a high-Q (13,300) PhC
around a single QD using marker structures yielding a spatial accuracy of 30 nm.
In the work discussed above,
the localization of QDs was performed via
SEM or AFM, respectively, while the optical properties had to be checked in
another characterization step via micro-photoluminescence (µPL) spectroscopy before
fabricating the ﬁnal device. The prospects and limitations of such combined methods
were studied in detail in Ref. [100]. In contrast, the reports presented in the following
enable one to localize and spectrally analyze the target QDs in a single imaging step,
while device fabrication was still performed by marker-based EBL. In Ref. [101] CL

spectroscopy was used to locate single QDs with respect to markers and plasmonic
nano-antennas were fabricated by EBL with an alignment accuracy better than 50 nm.
A similar lateral accuracy was reached in Ref. [102] by combining µPL and EBL with the
aid of markers to integrate single QDs into photonic crystals. Also, marker-based µPL
together with EBL was used in Ref. [97] to realize circular Bragg gratings around single
QDs with an accuracy of better than 30 nm. More recently, the same group reported a
further improved positioning uncertainty of 4.5 nm using a technically reﬁned method
[103].
A potential drawback of the marker-based deterministic approaches presented above
is the two-step process. While the optical pre-selection is performed for instance in
a µPL-setup, the sample processing is conducted via photolithography or EBL in a
dedicated lithography machine.
The spatial correspondence between the two setups
needs to be assured using marker structures on the sample surface that were fabricated
beforehand. These two steps make the fabrication more complex and therefore more
susceptible with respect to misalignments. The approaches presented in the following
perform both steps in a single machine, and therefore potentially oﬀer increased
alignment accuracy while reducing the process complexity.
3.3. In-situ techniques
A particular powerful class of approaches used for deterministic device fabrication
comprises in-situ techniques. Here, the pre-selection or creation of quantum emitters
and, if applicable, also the lithographic deﬁnition of a surrounding device are performed
in one and the same apparatus without transferring the sample or heating it up (if
the pre-selection was performed at cryogenic temperatures) [104].
This has several
appealing prospects: Firstly, the alignment accuracy is improved, as the coordinate
system is identical for both steps. Secondly it speeds up the fabrication, as no marker
or coordinate-system matching is required for each write ﬁeld. Not least, the setup
complexity is strongly reduced, as only a single machine is necessary.
A prominent example based on in-situ optical lithography is the work by Dousse
et. al [105] (see ﬁgure 4 (a)). This technique is based on a µPL setup using two diﬀerent
lasers with emission wavelengths of 750 nm and 532 nm, respectively. The sample is
coated with a photo-sensitive resist before it is mounted inside a cryostat for the cooldown to low temperatures (10 K). Using the 750 nm laser, the resist is not exposed
and a suitable target QD can be located using µPL-spectroscopy. After QD selection,
the green laser is used to expose the resist right above the quantum emitter. In the
next steps, the resist is developed at room temperature and a lift-oﬀprocess together
with chloride reactive ion etching is applied to deﬁne a micropillar cavity containing
the pre-selected target QD. This approach enables a spatial accuracy for the positioning
of micropillars of 50 nm. The fabrication of bright quantum-light sources using in-situ
optical lithography will be discussed in section 4.1 and 4.2.
Inspired by the work presented above, a deterministic device fabrication technique

electron microscope (SEM) was equipped with an extension for cathodoluminescence
lithography [109]. Here, the sample is ﬁrst spin-coated with an electron-beam resist at
room-temperature. After cooling down the sample to cryogenic temperatures of about
10 K, pre-selection of target QDs based on their brightness and emission wavelength is
performed by scanning the quantum emitters with the electron beam and mapping the
luminescence using a spectrometer attached to the SEM. In the next step, the electron
beam is used to deﬁne a photonic structure in the resist.
As the resist is already
exposed during the pre-selection process, the writing of the ﬁnal structure is performed
by inverting the resist, which directly acts as etch mask for the ﬁnal etch step after resist
development at room-temperature. Advantages of in-situ EBL, compared to the optical
counterpart, include (at least in principle) improved accuracy as well as high resolution,
and, in case of more complex structures such as waveguide circuits, also higher speed.
The overall lateral accuracy has been reported to be 34 nm [110], mainly limited by
temperature-induced mechanical drifts of the sample holder inside the SEM. A spatial
resolution below 10 nm should be within reach based on state-of-the-art EBL systems.
The speed for writing extended device patterns in the resist is faster compared to optical
in-situ lithography, as the electron-beam can be scanned quickly across the sample. In
Ref. [106], this approach has been used to fabricate deterministic QD mesa structures
with high device yield and high quantum optical properties. In section 4.1 and 4.2 the
fabrication of deterministically fabricated QD quantum-light sources will be presented,
which are based on a reﬁned in-situ EBL technique.
The in-situ lithography approaches presented above have so far been employed
mostly for QD systems. For colour centres, ion-implantation has been proven to be a
powerfull technique for the deterministic emitter positioning, which can be combined
with in-situ processing of photonic devices. In Ref. [111] Meijer et al. demonstrated
the generation of arrays of NV centres in a diamond crystal by implanting nitrogen
atoms and annealing the sample. For this purpose a beam of N+ ions produced by a
dynamitron tandem accelerator with an energy of 2 MeV and a diameter of 0.3 µm was
scanned stepwise across the sample. Later on, the implantation of ions for the generation
of NV centres has been implemented using focused ion beam (FIB) technology in
combination with a SEM in a dual-beam conﬁguration [107] (see ﬁgure 4 (c)), which
is much more practical then using a tandem accelerator. This technique has then also
been adapted for the generation of SiV centres in diamond [112, 108] (see ﬁgure 4 (d)) as
well as silicon carbide [113] crystals, and more recently also germanium-vacancies (GeV)
in diamond [114].
By combining ion-implantation with plasma etching techniques,
photonic microstructures such as nanopillars [113] or photonic-crystal cavities and
waveguides [115] can be realized in-situ.
These approaches, however, doo not allow
for the controlled implantation of a single ion with 100% yield, leading to a Poissonian
distribution of the numbers of NV centres per site.

3.4. Hybrid approaches
In some cases, it is beneﬁcial to combine diﬀerent material systems for the quantum
emitter on one hand and the photon collection or guiding on the other hand, to gain synergies of both worlds. Such device approaches in many cases need to make use of transfer
techniques to integrate the active nanophotonic part (including the quantum emitter)
with the passive part for enhanced photon collection and guiding (waveguides, cavities
or solid immersion lenses). Examples for transfer techniques include nano-manipulation
using the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) [116, 117] or a scanning electron microscope (SEM) [118, 119] or wafer-bonding [120], or so-called transfer printing, where
the emitter is embedded in a thin ﬁlm of rubber [121] or polymer [122]. Hybrid devices
fabricated in a deterministic fashion are summarized in Figure 5. In Ref.[123], the tip
of an AFM has been used for picking, transferring and placing single nanodiamonds
containing NV centres. Applying forces of 1 µN was suﬃcient to attach the nanodiamond to the tip via surface adhesion. To monitor the success of the pick-up procedure,
the ﬂuorescence of the nanodiamond was observed during tip movement. In that way,
nanodiamonds can be placed at the center of a gallium phosphide photonic crystal membrane cavity (see ﬁgure 5 (a)). The yield for this procedure was reported to be about one
third. Embedding the quantum emitter in a photonic device, can improve the photon
collection eﬃciency. Placing a nanodiamond for instance inside a PhC membrane cavity,
Wolters et al. demonstrated the Purcell enhancement of the ZPL emission of a single
NV center [124]. For the development of practical devices, also the coupling to optical
ﬁbers is highly desirable. This has been demonstrated for NV centres in nanodiamonds
positioned at the facet of a photonic crystal ﬁber [125] (see ﬁgure 5 (b)) or the waist
of a tapered optical ﬁber [126] using the pick-and-place technique discussed above. A
ﬁber-coupled single-photon emitting device based on a similiar approach adapted for
nanowires will be discussed in section 4.4. Furthermore, nanowires with integrated single QDs have also been deterministically integrated in silicon-based photonic waveguides
combining pick-and-place and waveguide processing [127] (see ﬁgure 5 (c)). Moreover,
the deterministic fabrication of hybrid GaAs/Si3N4 waveguide devices with integrated
pre-selected QDs (see ﬁgure 5 (d)) was recently demonstrated by Schnauber et al. in
an all-lithography-based approach [128], i.e. without requiring pick-and-place. For this
purpose the authors combined in-situ EBL on GaAs-based QD devices [106] with waferbonding to silicon-based waveguides [120]. Finally, Sartison et al. combined in-situ
photolithography with 3D laser writing to ﬁrst preselect a single QD, deﬁne markers,
and then fabricate a solid immersion lens on top of it [129] (see ﬁgure 5 (e)).

photonic quantum technologies. In this section we review solid-state-based quantumlight sources which are fabricated deterministically by using the approaches presented
in the previous section.
The performance of the discussed quantum-light sources will be compared using
the following quantities:
The quality factor, the photon extraction eﬃciency, the
antibunching value, the photon indistinguishability, and the entanglement ﬁdelity. In
the following we brieﬂy introduce each quantity.
The quality (Q) factor of an optical cavity is a measure for the storage time
of photons inside the resonator.
Experimentally, the Q-factor is extracted from
spectoscopic measurements and is given by the resonator’s frequency-to-bandwidth ratio
Q = ω/δω.
The photon extraction eﬃciency refers to the fraction of the total photon ﬂux
emitted by an emitter which is collected by a certain numerical aperture (NA) deﬁned
by the experimental apparatus. Depending on the far-ﬁeld characteristics of a photonic
device, smaller or larger NAs are suﬃcient to achieve high photon extraction eﬃciencies
into the ’ﬁrst lens’. The photon extraction eﬃciency can be determined by a careful
calibration of the experimental setup [130, 131].
The antibunching value g(2)(0) is a measure for the probability that a light
sources emits two photons at the same time and refers to the case of τ = t2 −t1 = 0
(zero temporal delay) for the photon autocorrelation g(2)(τ) of a given quantized light
ﬁeld [132]. An ideal single-photon source emits exactly one photon at a time leading

===== Page 17 =====

17
to g(2)(0) = 0, while g(2)(τ) = 1 for other delay times (sub-Poissonian statistics). A
perfectly coherent classical light source, e.g. a laser, is characterized by g(2)(0) = 1
(Poissonian statistics), while classical thermal light ﬁelds, emitted e.g. by light bulbs or
ﬂuorescent lamps, show 1 < g(2)(0) < 2 (super-Poissonian statistics). Experimentally,
g(2)(0) is determined via photon autocorrelation measurements in a Hanbury-Brown and
Twiss type setup [30]. In experiments under pulsed excitation, g(2)(0) is evaluated as
the integrated area of the τ = 0 coincidence peak divided by the average area of the
coincidence peaks at ﬁnite τ. Note, that g(2)(0) does neither depend on the vacuum
contributions present in the light ﬁeld, i.e. the eﬃciency of the light source, nor on the
decoherence.
The photon indistinguishability corresponds to the mean wavefunction overlap
of two photons from a statistical ensemble. Photons are called fully indistinguishable,
if they can be described by the same set of identical quantum numbers. The photon
indistinguishability can be determined via two-photon interference experiments in a
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) type setup [133, 134].
Here, two photons enter a 50:50
beamsplitter from diﬀerent ports and interfere with each other.
In case of perfect
indistinguishabillity, both photons always leave the beamsplitter in the same but
stochastically random exit port, as the probability amplitudes destructively interfere
for the cases where both photons are transmitted or reﬂected.
This HOM eﬀect
can be observed as antibunching in coincidence measurements at both exit ports.
In contrast to the antibunching in photon autocorrelation measurements, the photon
indistinguishability is crucially aﬀected by decoherence. Typically two measurements are
performed to experimentally determine the photon indistinguishability, one where the
input photons have parallel polarization orientation and the other one with orthogonal
polarization conﬁguration. The contrast or visibility between both measurements reveals
the photon indistinguishability. While most experiments use binary click detectors for
HOM experiments, photon-number resolving detectors are an interesting alternative
[135, 136].
The entanglement ﬁdelity F +, as referred to in this review article, is deﬁned
as the overlap of an experimentally generated two-photon wavefunction |Φ⟩with the
maximally entangled Bell state |Ψ+⟩= 1/
√
2(|HXXHX + VXXVX⟩). Note, that this Bell
state is entangled in the polarizations degree of freedom, while entanglement can also
be realized in diﬀerent degrees of freedom, also simultaneously [137]. Experimentally,
the entanglement ﬁdelity is determined using quantum tomography [138, 37], where
F + = 0.5 corresponds to a perfectly polarization-correlated but classical state and
F + = 1 to a maximally entangled state. Note, that also other criteria can be used to
quantify entanglement [38].

also known as micropillar cavities, with embedded stochastically grown QDs have
already been exploited in a variety of experiments [140] including strong light-matter
coupling [141], quantum key distribution [142], and boson sampling [143]. In all these
experiments, typically many devices needed to be scanned to ﬁnd QD-micropillars with
suﬃcient emitter-mode coupling due to the spatially and spectrally random distribution
of the emitters inside the cavity.
Today, deterministic fabrication techniques allow for precisely aligning quantum
emitters to micropillar structures, or vice versa, resulting in device yields close to
unity with optimized performance.
In 2009 Schneider et al.
demonstrated the ﬁrst
deterministically fabricated QD-micropillar device using site-controlled QD growth in
a bottom-up fashion [144] (cf.
section 3.1).
To achieve high optical quality of the
site-controlled QDs, two layered arrays of InAs QDs were grown on top of a nanohole
seeding-layer each separated by a GaAs buﬀer layer. Photoluminescence of the seedinglayer as well as of the ﬁrst QD layer was spectrally blue-shifted by about 30 nm relative
to the third QD layer using partial capping and annealing. The ordered arrays of sitecontrolled QDs were embedded in a λ-thick GaAs cavity sandwiched between a lower
and an upper distributed Bragg reﬂector containing 25 and 12 mirror pairs, respectively.
Next, micropillars have been fabricated spatially aligned with single positioned QDs
using alignment markers. This approach resulted in deterministically fabricated QDmicropillar cavities each containing a single quantum emitter with high yield (≈90%).
The tested device with a pillar diameter of 1 µm featured a Q-factor of 1700, which

enabled the observation of Purcell-enhanced triggered single-photon emission.
The
implementation of a top-down approach for the deterministic fabrication of single-photon
sources was reported in 2013 by Gazzano et al. [146]. Using the in-situ photolithography
developed in Ref.
[105] (cf.
ﬁgure 4(a)), the authors deterministically fabricated a
micropillar cavity containing a single pre-selected QD. This resulted in the observation of
large photon extraction eﬃciencies and high degrees of photon indistinguishability. This
technology has been further improved by integrating gates in p-i-n doped micropillars,
enabling a spectral tuning of the emission of integrated single quantum emitter relative
to the cavity mode [147]. These improvements ﬁnally culminated in the report on a
near-optimal single-photon source by Somaschi et al.
[145] and similar results from
another group [148]. In the ﬁrst report, single-photon indistinguishabilities of up to
(99.56 ± 0.45)% were observed, while the second work achieved extraction eﬃciencies of
up to (74±4)%. Besides the deterministic device technology itself, an important key for
achieving large indistinguishabilities and photon extraction eﬃciencies was the resonant
excitation scheme [149] used in both reports. This enables the on-demand generation
of single-photon states with near-unity generation probability while keeping dephasing
at a minimum.
A drawback of the micropillar strategy discussed above is their narrow bandwidth
character. As a consequence the precise spectral matching between cavity mode and
quantum emitter often requires an additional tuning-knob, such as temperature, strain
or electric ﬁeld. In order to support high photon extraction eﬃciencies in a wider spectral
window, nanowires [131], lens structures [151, 152] and circular Bragg gratings [153] can
been exploited.
In 2012 Reimer et al.
demonstrated a bright single-photon source
based on bottom-up grown tapered InP nanowires with integrated positioned InAsP
QDs. Although the spatial distribution of the nanowires was statistically random in
this work, each nanowire contained a single precisely aligned QD. After the growth,

the QD-nanowires were embedded in a transparent polymer and removed from the InP
substrate to facilitate the evaporation of a backside gold layer acting as mirror. This
approach enabled a photon extraction eﬃciency of 42% and a measured antibunching
value of g(2)(0) < 0.5 under continuous wave excitation. A spatially fully deterministic
nanowire approach was demonstrated by Holmes et al. using site-controlled growth of
GaN/AlGaN nanowires on a pre-patterned sapphire substrate [150]. In this approach,
the nanowires were arranged in ordered arrays and the tip of the nanowire contained
a single GaN QD. Due to the strong quantum-conﬁnement possible in this material
system, the approach enabled the observation of single-photon emission in the UV-B
spectral window up to room-temperature (300 K) with a measured g(2)(0)-value of 0.33.
Other recent work on broadband deterministically fabricated QD-based quantum-light
sources use hybrid SIL-based devices [129] (cf.
section 3.4) or the lensing eﬀect of
metallic nanorings for eﬃcient photon extraction [154], also in combination with solid
immersion lenses [155].
An particular useful approach was developed in our group by extending the insitu EBL approach described in section 3.3 to three-dimensional structures. Instead of
using a ﬁxed electron dose, resulting in mesa structures as illustrated in ﬁgure 4 (b),
we found that a variable dose in the negative-tone regime of the resist (grey-scale
lithography) can be used to realize curved surfaces of the photonic structure hosting
the single quantum emitter. This has been used by Gschrey et al. to deterministically
fabricate a photonic microlens with a single embedded QD acting as bright single photon
source [156, 157] (see ﬁgure 8). In combination with a back-side DBR the device showed
broadband photon extraction eﬃciencies of (23 ± 3)% into an NA of 0.4, low multiphoton emission probabilities g(2)(0) < 0.01, and high photon indistinguishabilities,
even well beyond saturation of the quantum emitter. In subsequent investigations, we
used these QD-microlenses to explore diﬀerent meachnisms of dephasing limiting the
indistinguishability of photons emitted by the quantum emitter [158]. In particular we

found, that the two-photon interference visibility decreases with increasing temporal
separation between consecutively emitted photons (see ﬁgure 9), which is theoretically
described by a non-Markovian noise process. At short temporal separations (2 ns) and
low temperatures (10 K) we observed photon indistinguishabilities of up to (96 ± 4)%
under quasi-resonant excitation of the quantum emitter. Furthermore we showed, that
the performance of QD-microlens-based SPSs can be further improved in terms of the
photon extraction eﬃcieny by employing anti-reﬂection coatings [159]. Additionally, the
achievable single-photon ﬂux has been dramatically increased, by pushing the excitation
rate to the limits of the quantum emitters using a mode-locked vertical-external-cavity
surface-emitting laser at 500 MHz repetition rate [160]. Beyond the work reported at
emission wavelengths of about 900 nm, also triggered single-photon emission in the
telecom O-band has been demonstrated with QD-microlenses [161].
Meanwhile, the
microlens approach has been also adapted by other groups using in-situ photolithography
in combination with wet-chemical etching [162].
4.2. Multi-photon sources
Beyond single-photon generation, the creation of more complex multi-photon states is
an extremely exciting and challenging task at the heart of quantum optics. Applications
range from quantum repeaters based on sources of entangled photon pairs, quantumenhanced sensing using N00N-states [163] to photonic quantum computing with
entangled photonic cluster states [164]. The increased complexity of the task of distilling
a speciﬁc multi-photon state, however, typically translates into more demanding
boundary conditions for the quantum emitter and its surrounding device. In case of
QDs, the XX-X radiative cascade intrinsically oﬀers the possibility to produce highly
correlated pairs of photons (cf. section 2.1). Due to the typical energy scales for the

===== Page 22 =====

XX binding energy (EXX
bin ≈1 meV) and the ﬁne-structure splitting of the exciton state
(∆EFSS ≈10 µeV), emission of the cascade leads usually to two doublets of orthogonally
linearly polarized emission lines visible in the emission spectra, exhibiting spectrally
distinguishable photons.
But there exist three particular interesting speciﬁc constellations for XX binding
energies and ﬁne-structure splittings, respectively. The possibly best known and most
studied case corresponds to a QD with a zero ﬁne-structure splitting but a ﬁnite XX
binding energy. This case results in the emission of polarization-entangled photon pairs
[35, 37, 165], as discussed in the context of deterministic device fabrication in more
detail below. Another type of entanglement which can be produced with the XX-X
cascade has been proposed as entanglement via time-reodering, which requires a ﬁnite
ﬁne-structure splitting but zero XX binding energy [166]. To the best of our knowledge,
this case has not been used for entanglement generation yet. The last case refers to
a XX-X cascade, where the ﬁne-structure splitting exactly matches the XX binding
energy. While no entanglement is involved here, this speciﬁc energy level conﬁguration
enables the generation of photon twins - a non-classical light state constituted of two
temporally correlated photons with identical emission energy and polarization. In the
following we will ﬁrst discuss experiments based on polarization entanglement using
QDs with low ﬁne-structure splittings and then present work on twin-photon emitters.
The ﬁrst deterministically fabricated device capable of emitting polarizationentangled photon pairs has been demonstrated by Dousse et al.
in 2010 in a topdown approach [49].
Using in-situ photolithography, a so-called ’photonic molecule’
comprising two partially merged micropillars has been processed deterministically
around a pre-selected QD (see ﬁgure 10(a)). The engineered hybridization of the optical
modes of this photonic molecule [169] enabled the authors to simultaneously achieve high
photon extraction eﬃciency for exciton and biexciton emission of the integrated QD.
This sophisticated approach enabled an entangled photon pair rate of 0.12 per excitation
pulse and an entanglement ﬁdelity F + to the state |Ψ+⟩of 0.59.
In a bottom-up
approach, Braun et al. observed correlated photon pairs of the XX-X cascade of sitecontrolled InP/GaInP QDs [170]. The ﬁne-structure splitting of the fabricated QDs,
however, was 300 µeV on average, which was too large for entanglement experiments. A
successful entanglement experiment based on site-controlled QDs was ﬁrst reported by
Juska et al. by employing pyramidal In0.25Ga0.75As1−δNδ QDs grown on (111)-oriented
substrate [167].
Due to the high symmetry of the realized QDs (see ﬁgure 10(b)),
ﬁne-structure splittings below 4 µeV have been observed for ordered arrays of quantum
emitters, as reported also earlier by another group [171, 172]. Entanglement ﬁdelities
of up to 0.721 ± 0.043 were observed, while the overall yield of positioned QDs showing
F + > 0.5 reached 15%.
Many of the reports discussed above achieved high entanglement ﬁdelities, but did
not satisfy other requirements relevant for entanglement-based quantum information
processing. In fact, it is extremely challenging to simultaneously achieve high photon
extraction eﬃciency, high photon indistinguishability and hight entanglement ﬁdelity

in a single device.
Recently this task has been mastered by Liu et al.
using a
deterministically fabricated solid-state-based entangled photon pair source comprising
a single QD embedded in a circular Bragg resonator integrated on a broadband reﬂector
[168].
The device (see ﬁgure 10(c)), exploiting a broadband Purcell eﬀect, enabled
the generation of entangled photon pairs with a collection eﬃciency of 0.65(4), an
entanglement ﬁdelity of 0.88(2), and an indistinguishability of 0.901(3) and 0.903(3)
for X and XX respectively. Here, the authors used two-photon resonant excitation [173]
to achieve the on-demand generation of XX-X photon pairs. Similar results were also
reported for a non-deterministically fabricated device by Wang et al. [174]. Further

improvements in the device performance may be possible by using polarization-selective
Purcell microcavities [175].
In cases where the ﬁne-structure splitting is large compared to the homogenous
linewidth, the polarization entanglement between XX-X photon pairs will be washed out
in time-integrated experiments [176]. Still the entanglement can be restored by temporal
postselection, if the temporal resolution of the setup is suﬃcient. Based on this idea,
Huber et al. observed polarization-entangled photon pairs with a ﬁdelity of 0.76 emitted
by the XX-X cascade of a single QD despite a ﬁne-structure splitting of 18 µeV [177]. The
single InAsP QDs were embedded in ordered arrays of tapered InP nanowires. To resolve
the temporal evolution of the entangled two-photon state, avalanche photo diodes with a
temporal resolution of 35 ps were employed. While this work was conducted under nonresonant excitation into the conduction band of InP, resonant excitation schemes provide
the clear beneﬁt of reduced decoherence. Employing resonant two-photon excitation
of the XX-X cascade of a QD embedded in a deterministically fabricated microlens,
Bounouar et al. reported the generation of a maximally entangled state [178]. Here,
the oscillating temporal evolution of the polarization-entangled photon pair state was
observed for two diﬀerent quantum emitters with a ﬁne-structure splitting of 16 µeV
and 30 µeV, respectively. Similiar results have been obtained also for non-deterministic
device approaches [179].
In the experiments discussed above, the biexciton binding energy was large
compared to the ﬁne-structure splitting. This energy level alignment present in most
QDs leads to spectrally separated emission lines from the XX- and X-state, respectively.
Recently we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time, that also the special case of an energetically
degenerate XX-X cascade can be realized with QDs [39].
For this purpose, we
selected deterministically fabricated QD microlenses with a XX-X cascade satisfying
the condition ∆EFSS=|EXX
bin|. For this speciﬁc case, the X- and the XX-photon have
the same emission energy for either H or V polarization, while they are spectrally
separated by twice the ﬁne-structure splitting for the respective orthogonal polarization
(see ﬁgure 11 (a)).
Polarization ﬁltering of the energetically degenerate decay path
thus enables the distillation of photon twins - a non-classical light state constituted
of two temporally correlated photons with identical emission energy and polarization.
Figure 11 (b) presents polarization dependent µPL spectra of a QD, showing such a
behavior. The high degree of temporal correlations present in the emitted twin-photon
state leads to a huge bunching eﬀect in photon auto-correlation measurements using
a HBT setup (see ﬁgure 11 (c)). A more direct observation of the photon twins was
possible in this work, by employing a photon-number-resolving detection system based
on superconducting transition edge sensors. As displayed in Figure 11 (d), we were able
to clearly identify the events originating from the emission of photon twins and, further
more, directly compare the photon number distribution to a QD-based single-photon
source serving as reference. In a very recent study, Moroni et al. picked up this idea
and studied similiar cases in site-controlled pyramidal QDs [40].

al. used vertically-stacked coupled QDs integrated in site-controlled nanowires [180].
In this approach, the hybridized excitonic states of the two QDs form a triexcitonbiexciton-exciton cascade, consecutively emitting three photons with diﬀerent energies.
Noteworthy, the generation of three-photon states can also be achieved in a single QD
using its triexciton-biexciton-exciton radiative cascade, as demonstrated by Schmidgall
et al. in a non-deterministic device approach [181]. And even four-photon states can be
generated using a single QD emitter in this fashion [182].
4.3. Electrically-driven quantum-light sources
Early work on deterministically-fabricated electrically-driven single-QD light emitting
diodes conﬁrmed the prospects for device integration [183, 184, 86], a proof that the
electrically-pumped QD emission was antibunched, however, was still missing. The ﬁrst
electrically-driven quantum-light source based on a deterministic fabrication technology
was reportet in 2012 by Schneider et al.
[185].
In this work, single site-controlled
InAs QDs have been integrated in micropillar cavities incorporating a p-i-n doped
diode structure (see Figure 12 (a)).

5 AlAs/GaAs mirror pairs in the lower and upper DBR, respectively, enabled a Qfactor of 230. This enabled the authors to demonstrate single-photon emission with
g(2)(0) = 0.42 (considering the temporal resolution of the experimental setup) of the
Purcell-enhanced emission of a deterministically integrated QD under direct current
injection. Due to the nanohole seeding layer in close vicinity to the site-controlled QDs,
the observed linewidth of the QD emission was about one order of magnitude larger as
compared to high-quality stochastically grown QDs in this material system. Unrau et
al. demonstrated in Ref. [186] a QD single-photon emitting diode with signiﬁcantly
improved optical properties based on site-controlled QDs positioned via a buried oxide
aperture (cf. ﬁgure 2 (c) in section 3.1). The device illustrated in ﬁgure 12 (b) showed
resolution limited linewidths of 25 µeV and pronounced antibunching of g(2)(0) = 0.05.
More recently, a deterministically fabricated single-photon light emitting diode has also
been realized based on the pre-selection of self-organized QDs and subsequent device
fabrication using in-situ photolithography [187] (see ﬁgure 12 (c)). The authors achieved
a measured antibunching of g(2)(0) = 0.42±0.02 under pulsed electrical current injection
at 200 MHz. The ﬁrst deterministically-fabricated entangled-light-emitting diode was
reported by Chung et al. based on arrays of pyramidal QDs grown on (111)B oriented
GaAs substrate [188] (see ﬁgure 12 (d)). As discussed already in section 3.1, this type of
quantum emitter intrinsically shows small ﬁne-structure splitting for the bright exciton
state and is thus well suited for the generation of polarization-entangled photo pairs.
The device showed entanglement ﬁdelities of the emitted two-photon state of 0.73±0.06

4.4. Plug-and-play quantum-light sources
In view of the huge progress achieved in the fabrication of deterministic devices at
the chip level (see previous sections), recent eﬀorts aim also at the development of
more practical plug-and-play devices. To achieve this goal, a direct ﬁber coupling of
the respective quantum devices is beneﬁcial.
Pioneering work in this direction has
been performed by Xu et al. in Ref. [189] and Haupt et al. in Ref. [190] using nondeterministic device approaches. More recently, Caddedu et al. reported in Ref. [191] a
ﬁber-coupled QD on a photonic tip (see ﬁgure 13 (a)) using deterministic technologies.
For this purpose, a so-called photonic trumpet [193] with an embedded InAs QD
was precisely attached to the core of a single mode optical ﬁber using a pick-andplace method with custom-made micro-manipulators inside a SEM. For testing singlephoton emission, the ﬁber-coupled quantum emitter was plunged into liquid helium
and connected to a ﬁber-based PL setup. Under continuous wave (CW) wetting-layer
excitation, a clear antibunching g(2)(0) < 0.5 was observed in a HBT experiment,
which was only limited by the setup’s temporal resolution. To develop quantum-light
sources which are even more practical, one has either to get rid of the necessity for
cooling, by working on the material’s side, or one applies more practical techniques

for cooling the quantum emitter. Although room-temperature operation of QD singlephoton sources has been demonstrated (see section 4.1 and Ref. [150]), the quantumoptical properties of the generated photons and the achieved brightness is so far
insuﬃcient for most applications in photonic quantum technologies. Stirling cryocoolers
[194] have been evaluated as compact, cost-eﬀective, and user-friendly alternative to
liquid-helium bath or ﬂow cryostats and closed-cycle refrigerators. The applicability of
Stirling cryocoolers for the operation of quantum emitters has ﬁrst been demonstrated
in 2015 by Schlehahn et al., using a deterministically fabricated QD mesa cooled to
a base-temperature of about 29 K [195].
Based on this idea, we recently presented
a stand-alone ﬁber-coupled single-photon source [192], comprising a deterministicallyfabricated ﬁber-coupled QD single-photon source inside a compact Stirling cryocooler
ﬁtting into a 19-inch rack box (see ﬁgure 13 (b)). The ﬁber-coupled QD emission provides
the user with a photonﬂux stable on a time-scale of several days and antibunching
values as small as g(2)(0) = 0.07 ± 0.05 under CW optical excitation (using external
spectral ﬁltering). Additionally the high durability of the direct ﬁber-connection was
demonstrated in endurance tests, revealing stable collection of the QD emission within
4% over several cool-down/warm-up cycles. Our device thus demonstrated for the ﬁrst
time, that practical high-performance plug-and-play quantum-light sources suitable for
applications outside shielded lab environments are within reach. The eﬃciency of this
ﬁrst demonstrator in terms of the photon extraction probability per pulse, however, was
below 1%, limited by the ﬁber-coupling eﬃciency and the photon extraction eﬃciency
of the used microlens device. A crucial next step in this direction will therefore be
to improve the coupling eﬃciency to single-mode optical ﬁbers in such modular and
robust approaches, e.g.
by deterministically integrating micropillar cavities [196] or
numerically optimized circular Bragg gratings for operation at telecom wavelengths
[197]. Another important step will be the implementation of coherent excitation schemes
for portable quantum-light sources.
Many reports on state-of-the-art quantum-light
sources use strict-resonant [145, 148, 175], two-photon resonant [178, 168, 174], or, more
recently, dichromatic coherent excitation [198] for the on-demand generation of quantum
light states (cf.
section 4).
The implementation of such schemes in compact and
integrated approaches, however remains challenging, as the required laser systems and
pulse-shapers are rather bulky. In this regard the development of compact and tunable
picosecond pulsed laser systems would be an important technological achievement,
further boosting the realization of practical quantum-light sources.
5. Applications and future perspectives
The progress achieved in the development of deterministic fabrication techniques has
signiﬁcantly improved the device yield and the performance of quantum-light sources.
During the next decade, this development will push applications of photonic quantum
technologies far beyond its current status. To date, most proof-of-concept experiments
in the ﬁeld of quantum communication and quantum computing have been demonstrated

based on non-deterministic device approaches.
In case of QDs, examples include
quantum key distribution (QKD) via the BB84 protocol [199, 200, 201, 202, 142], spinphoton[203, 204], spin-spin [205] and photon-photon [164] entanglement as well as boson
sampling [143]. Also NV and SiV colour centres in diamond crystals have been used for
QKD proof-of-principles [206, 207, 208] and tests of Bell inequality [209].
To surpass the proof-of-principle stage and to realize systems with increased
complexity, however, scalable device technologies are crucial.
Building multi-node
quantum communication networks or photonic quantum computers, for instance, many
indistinguishable quantum-light sources are required.
Therefore, these applications
might well be the ﬁrst, where deterministically fabricated single-photon and entangled
photon-pair sources make the diﬀerence.
First experiments in photonic quantum
technologies exploiting deterministic devices include a boson sampling machine using
micropillar single-photon sources [210]. Moreover, two-photon interference experiments
on remote deterministically fabricated micropillar single-photon sources [211] as
well as QD microlenses [158] were demonstrated, which rise prospects for scalable
implementations of device-independent schemes of QKD [212, 4] and quantum repeater
networks. Furthermore, also the development of devices integrated on-chip will strongly
beneﬁt from deterministic device technologies. Building on earlier non-deterministic
device approaches [213, 214], we recently demonstrated an on-chip HBT experiment
using a single pre-selected QD deterministically integrated into a monolithic waveguide
circuit comprising a multi-mode interference beamsplitter [215].
The substantially
improved device yield of such deterministic approaches raises prospects for the
fabrication of complex photonic circuits on-chip. Not least, also the ﬁeld of quantum
metrology can be boosted by deterministic devices. Here, the development of absolute
single-photon sources and the deﬁnition of the SI unit Candela will be particularly
beneﬁtting by the high degree of scalability of quantum-light sources.
