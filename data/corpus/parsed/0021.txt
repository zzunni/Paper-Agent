Qubit information processors are increasing in footprint but currently rely on e-beam lithography
for patterning the required Josephson junctions (JJs). Advanced optical lithography is an alternative
patterning method, and we report on the development of transmon qubits patterned solely with
optical lithography. The lithography uses 193 nm wavelength exposure and 300-mm large silicon
wafers. Qubits and arrays of evaluation JJs were patterned with process control which resulted in
narrow feature distributions: a standard deviation of 0.78% for a 220 nm linewidth pattern realized
across over half the width of the wafers. Room temperature evaluation found a 2.8 −3.6% standard
deviation in JJ resistance in completed chips. The qubits used aluminum and titanium nitride ﬁlms
on silicon substrates without substantial silicon etching. T1 times of the qubits were extracted at 26
µs – 27 µs, indicating a low level of material-based qubit defects. This study shows that large wafer
optical lithography on silicon is adequate for high-quality transmon qubits, and shows a promising
path for improving many-qubit processors.
I. INTRODUCTION
Currently, quantum processors allow demonstrations
of quantum error correction [1–4], chemical simulations
[5, 6], and factoring [7]. These prototype processors contain at least four transmon qubits [8, 9] as high coherence
elements on small (e.g., 5 mm) chips [3, 7]. There have
been reports of these superconducting qubits, fabricated
on sapphire substrates and measured in 3D cavities, with
relaxation (T1) and coherence times of 100 µs [8, 10].
On silicon substrates, the standard for CMOS fabrication, the same transmon qubits generally have shorter T1
times, with an optimized design showing approximately
30 (50) µs with (without) a silicon substrate etch to remove material-based loss [11]. In an attempt to increase
the size of quantum processors, larger (e.g., 10 mm) chips
are being optimized to reduce the aﬀects from parasitic
microwave modes in the sample box and wiring crosstalk
[12–14].
While coherent qubits and bus resonators have a large
footprint, the former require a small Josephson junction
with a tunneling barrier area of ≤0.04 µm2 and a lateral
JJ dimension of ≤200 nm [8, 15–18]. While all JJs are
believed to have two-level defects in the tunneling barrier
that resonantly coupled to the qubit, small junctions may
result in enhanced coherence because the contained defect density per unit frequency should be smaller than in
large JJs [19, 20]. Statistics of these small JJs have been
collected using ≥100 JJs on small chip areas [15, 21]. In
the ﬁrst study [21] the write ﬁeld is only apparently 2 mm
in its largest dimension and intentionally set to be small
for uniformity. There it was found that the normal-state
resistance of these JJs has a standard deviation of 3.5%
for all JJs in one fabrication run, a statistic which is key
since it is inversely proportional to the Josephson critical
current. In the second study [15] many dc-SQUIDs were
evaluated on few-mm chips. They were found to have
a lower standard deviation (for pairs of JJs within) in
this small ﬁeld area. The required tolerance for JJ critical current and related qubit frequency depends on the
quantum computing gate architecture.
In a successful
non-tunable architecture, cross-resonant gates are used
on the qubits [22–24]. In this technique the qubits must
have a frequency interval close to the qubit anharmonicity, which is only 3-5% of the qubit frequency, and places
challenging constraints on the lithography. While e-beam
lithography works well for previous circuits, it also appears that this method is unproven for large exposure
ﬁelds (e.g., 10 mm quantum processors).
Optical lithography, developed in the CMOS industry, is well known to produce nearly identical features
over large areas [25].
The narrowest resolvable lithographic line is given by k1λ/NA, indicating the important variables of lithographic wavelength λ and numerical
aperture NA. A numerical factor close to unity, k1, accounts for process-related parameters such as resolutionenhancement techniques, coherence of the light source,
etc [26]. Following the introduction of 365 nm wavelength
lithography (known as i-line), came 248 nm wavelength
(known as Deep UV) started producing CMOS processors in 1999 [25, 27]. While we are not aware of published
reports of transmons fabricated solely from optical lithogarXiv:1902.08501v1  [physics.app-ph]  22 Feb 2019

raphy, there is a recent set of studies on 248 nm optical
lithography for JJ digital logic circuits [28–30]. The ﬁrst
study found a standard deviation of 8% for the resistance
of 300 nm diameter Nb/AlOx JJs on chips from 248 nm
lithography on 200 mm wafers [29]. Furthermore, a need
for 248 nm and 193 nm lithography was identiﬁed for JJ
circuits [29].
Here we present the ﬁrst report of transmon qubits patterned solely with optical lithography on 300 mm wafers
at the facility at SUNY Polytechnic. This facility is already used for integrated photonics and neuromorphic
computing research [31–35]. These qubits depend on 220
nm linewidth features for JJs fabricated using 193 nm
photo lithography on 300 mm silicon wafers. The resist
patterning was characterized over a ∼170 mm region of
the wafer. JJs, fabricated in test arrays and qubits, were
completed on coupons (chips) with a 33 mm × 25 mm
area, with a small standard deviation in resistance. Two
nominally-identical qubits separated by 12.5 mm were
characterized in their relaxation, and coherence times.
The study reveals the realization of high-performance
qubits fabricated using advanced tools developed for the
CMOS-industry, i.e., large-ﬁeld optical lithography on
silicon substrates.
Optical lithography, using a reticle
patterned as shown in Figure 1, permits Josephson structures to be ‘written’ into the photoresist in parallel on
many large chips. In contrast, e-beam lithography actually writes the pattern serially with a beam, and thus is
relatively slow for large patterns. Furthermore it must
use stitching of many write ﬁelds to realize 10 mm chip.
II. FABRICATION
While a wide range of resistivity, up to 20 kΩ-cm, is
available on smaller Si wafers, it is more limited for 300
mm Si wafers leading to the question of whether high performance qubits can be realized on the latter wafers. This
study utilizes two batches with resistivity speciﬁed in the
range of 2-13 kΩ-cm. We use the batch with larger resistivity of 10 kΩ-cm for millikelvin measurements of qubits.
Measurements using a KLA-Tencor SP3 detect only 10
and 17 particulate defects >90 nm from two randomly selected wafers, as evidence of starting surface cleanliness
of the wafer. 40nm of TiN is grown using physical vapor
deposition after a dilute HF-last surface clean of the Si
wafer, and found to have a (200) texture by XRD analysis. The TiN ﬁlm is then patterned to form the probe
pads in the Josephson junction arrays and the paddles
in the qubits (see Fig. 2(a)). It should be noted that
the silicon surface outside the TiN pattern will be once
again covered with its native oxide. A wafer is then spincoated with 530 nm of polydimethylglutarimide-based resist (PMGI SF6 series, from MicroChem) in a stand-alone
track, and baked. This is followed by spin-coating (and
baking) a 208 nm-thick layer of a commercial 193 nm pos80

itive photoresist. The pattern for the junctions is transferred into this resist layer using an ASML TWINSCAN
AT:1200B system.
The pattern is 33 mm × 12.5 mm, which is repeated
across the wafer and containing two sections: arrays of
individual JJs and qubits (see Fig. 1). After exposure
the wafer is immediately baked and developed using a
0.26N TMAH-based solution. Through optimization of
development time, resist is not only selectively removed
to form the Dolan bridge, but the amount of underlying
lift-oﬀresist is also removed from beneath the bridge (see
Fig. (2b)). The latter is conﬁrmed using tilt-view SEM
observations of several samples. Josephson junction arrays with varying junction dimensions are formed with
top electrode ‘ﬁnger’ widths ranging from 80 nm to 500
nm (see Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 2(a) (iv)), and Dolan bridge
widths ranging from 380 nm to 500 nm. The 220 nm
ﬁnger feature in the array is targeted for lithographic exposure optimization since the qubits in this study used
220 nm wide ﬁnger feature for JJ formation (and incidentally use a Dolan bridge width of 440 nm). Figure 2(f)
shows the measured ﬁnger feature widths across a central
176 mm × 130 mm region of the wafer, associated with a
standard deviation of 1.7 nm, i.e., 0.78% of the median.
Measurements of our 440 nm wide bridges in the array
are conﬁrmed to have similarly low standard deviation,
0.67% of the median.
The wafer is then cleaved into coupons (chips) of approximately 45 mm × 35 mm area containing at least 2
repeated patterns (see Fig. (1)). The coupons are loaded

into an e-beam evaporation system that is ‘pre-seasoned’
by two evaporations of aluminum. Lack of metal contamination from prior users of the evaporation tool is veriﬁed
through secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis of the deposited aluminum ﬁlms. Starting from a pressure below 5×10−7 Torr, the wafer is then sputtered with
Ar for 4 minutes to clean organic contaminants. Separate
tests determine that the sputtering decreases photoresist
ﬁlm thickness but not SiO2 ﬁlm thickness. After sputtercleaning for ≈60 s in base pressure, the bottom electrode
of the JJ is formed by normal (0◦sample tilt) evaporation
of 30 nm of aluminum, at a deposition rate of 0.1 nm/s.
The aluminum is subjected to in-situ oxidation with a
20% O2 in Ar mixture ﬂowing at a controlled rate of 800
sccm, with the turbomolecular pump closed oﬀand the
chamber connected to the roughing pump. The system
pressure under these ﬂow conditions is ≈0.23 Torr based
on measurements during several nominally identical runs
and oxidation times fall in the range 30–120 minutes (to
tune the junction resistance). After completing oxidation, we pump the chamber down and deposit 60 nm of
Al using 55◦evaporation at the previous deposition rate
(see Fig. 2(c)). The Al deposition made contact to the
underlying TiN paddles. The coupons are subjected to
lift-oﬀwith NMP with gentle mechanical agitation, followed by an IPA rinse and N2 blow-dry (see Fig. 2(d)).
Figure 2(d) and Ref. [36] indicate that the JJ area had
variability beyond the tightly controlled linewidth in the
resist pattern caused by rough evaporated-line features,
and we view this as an important contributor to the variability of the realized JJ area. Transmission electron microscopy of cross-sections of the JJ conﬁrms good step
coverage and continuity of the top Al layer over the bottom Al layer as well as the presence of a thin layer of native oxide of Si under the Al as expected (see Fig. 2(e)).
This oxide could limit the relaxation time of qubits due
to dielectric loss [8, 37, 38] (but can be addressed in the
future).
III. MEASUREMENT
A. Room-Temperature Characterization
We characterize JJ arrays using a voltage sweep from
-0.2V to 0.2V. We extract JJ resistance using a linear
ﬁt to I-V curves. Data revealing open, shorted, or nonlinear I-V curves (with a coeﬃcient of determination R2
< 0.999), are deﬁned as ‘bad’ and excluded from further
analysis. The yield of ‘good’ junctions in the arrays is
well over 90% for ﬁnger widths of 140 nm and greater.

pled JJs spread over the area of ≈25 mm×16 mm on
the chip.
For the targeted ﬁnger width, which is 220
nm, we found that the resistances had standard deviations of 2.8% −3.6%. Our variability compares well to
optimized e-beam lithography which was sampled over a
much smaller area [21]. On each chip with the same JJ
arrays as above, there are two qubits with the target JJ
type, spaced by 12.5 mm from one another (recall the half
chip pattern in Fig. 1(a)). These qubits were probed on
four chips with generally diﬀerent oxidation conditions.
From these data, the hand-probed qubit JJ resistance
was found to be within the 95% conﬁdence bounds of the

corresponding JJs in the arrays, as expected (see Fig.
3(b)). Chip 1 and 2 were nominally oxidized the same
way, and the 8.5% diﬀerence between these runs is very
close to the run-to-run diﬀerence seen previously for similarly small JJs [15]. Chips 3 and 4 were intentionally
fabricated with a larger oxidation time.
Now we compare our standard deviation of 2.8%−3.6%
for an area of ≈25 mm×16 mm with other fabrication
techniques. E-beam lithography is known to allow uniform JJs with a standard deviation of 3.5% over an approximate 2 mm distance.
This is a similar variation
but the JJs are located in an order-of-magnitude smaller
lateral distance than this study. The previous deep submicron optical JJ fabrication for digital circuits [29] used
λ = 248 nm wavelength on 200 mm wafers, and contrasts
our λ=193 nm process on 300 mm wafers in a number of
ways. Their fabrication exposed a circular area for the
JJ, whereas ours exposed a line ending in a gap for the
Dolan bridge. In their 800 nm diameter JJs the standard deviation is 3% in resistance, and for the 300 nm
diameter JJs the standard deviation is 8%. Our standard deviation for the 220 nm line JJ is 2.8% −3.6%.
Although our 220 nm feature JJs show lower variability
compared to their 300 nm diameter JJs, the fabrication
techniques are also diﬀerent. 200 nm lines have recently
been fabricated for superconducting circuit elements using 248 nm lithography [30]. Some of the excess JJ resistance standard deviation of ∼3% over the photolithograph linewidth deviation 0.78%, is due to uniformity
limited by the Dolan-bridge fabrication; other techniques
are known which deﬁne the JJ only with straight edges
and hence might improve upon this [39].
B. Millikelvin Characterization
Two transmon qubits from 12.6 mm separation on the
wafer are measured.
Each transmon is nominally the
same, with a paddle spacing of 40 µm, paddle width of
250 µm, paddle length of 500 µm, for a total transmon
length of 1.040 mm (see Fig. 1(b)). Each qubit, on a
5 mm square chip, is mounted in its own 3D aluminum
cavity with two measurement ports, creating qubit-cavity
samples 1 and 2 (see Fig.
4 (a)).
The samples are
both cooled to 10 mK in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator.
The output signal from the cavity, passing
through a 12 GHz low pass ﬁlter and three microwave
isolators, is ampliﬁed at 3K using a low-noise HEMT
ampliﬁer. After further ampliﬁcation at room temperature, two quadrature signals of the resonator are acquired through homodyne detection and then digitized
after low-pass ﬁltering. For samples 1 (shown in Fig 4
(b)) and 2, the large-drive-power or bare resonance frequency occurs at ωc/2π = 7.8291 GHz and 7.7517 GHz,
respectively.
Using the qubit induced dispersive shift
of the cavity at low power, we extracted the dispersive

shift of χ/2π = −0.86 MHz and –0.97 MHz, respectively
[40]. The cavity linewidths revealed cavity decay rates of
κ/2π = 340 kHz and 370 kHz (for sample 1 and 2).
We perform qubit spectroscopy and more precise measurements using Ramsey fringes to ﬁnd the qubit frequencies. The results show the 1.33% diﬀerence in qubit
transition frequencies.
Additionally, using excitations
to the second excited state we obtain charging energies
EC/h of approximately 290 and 280 MHz for samples 1
and 2, respectively. From measurements of χ = g2/∆
and qubit-cavity detuning ∆, we extract couplings of
approximately g/2π = 54 MHz for both qubits.
The
transition frequency of the transmon can be expressed as
ωq =
p
π∆/(¯hRNC), where RN is the junction resistance
and C is the total capacitance. Since over > 90% of C is
attributed to ﬁelds external to the Josephson junction trilayer, i.e., the paddles, shunt capacitance, C is relatively
constant. This explains why the EC is the same between
qubits within the precision of our measurements. Using
this square root scaling of the qubit frequency and the
above standard deviation for the room-temperature resistance (2.8−3.6%), we ﬁnd that this corresponds to an
expected standard deviation of ≤1.8% in qubit frequencies. As expected the 1.33% diﬀerence observed in qubit

the qubit and cavity into a classically distinguishable system
using power at fbare. The optimal power is found when the

frequencies is consistent with the room temperature JJ
characterization.
In time domain measurements, Rabi oscillations of the
qubit are obtained to calibrate the pulse amplitude with
a π-pulse duration of approximately 60 ns.
We characterize the qubit’s energy relaxation by performing a
T1 measurement, which is often a limiting factor in coherence time. First we apply a π pulse precisely at the
qubit transition frequency, and then wait for a variable
amount of time, τ, to apply the readout pulse [41]. The
decay of population in the excited state, P1 is shown in
Fig. 4 (c) and (d). Each data point represents the average measured voltage of 104 identical experiments for
a given value of τ. The data is ﬁtted by a single exponential for an extracted T1 of 26.1 and 26.7 µs in qubits
1 and 2, respectively. These times were measured over
multiple days and deemed to be limited by loss since
the Purcell decay is negligible. The T1 value is comparable with state-of-the-art transmon design on Si which
has a relaxation time of approximately 30 µs [11] prior
to silicon etching (and JJ suspension) which reduces the
presence of materials. We note that other work uses deep
etching with nitride superconductors for high coherence
[42], while our etching is only on the nanometer scale.
Our work thus ﬁnds a low level of loss from carefully prepared materials: the large-Si substrate, the PVD TiN,
evaporated Al, and material interfaces with some native
oxides.
We also performed a Ramsey measurement to determine qubit frequency precisely and dephasing time T ∗
2
(see inset of Fig. 4(d)). For this, the measurement sequence consisted of two π/2 pulses to the qubit at a frequency 1-2 MHz detuned from the expected qubit frequency with a varying time delay τ between the pulses,
followed by a readout pulse. The Ramsey measurement
gives fringes of the excited state population oscillating
in time. The oscillation frequency is precisely the difference between the qubit frequency and the drive frequency, which we use to obtain the qubit transition frequencies 4.7661 GHz and 4.7027 GHz, respectively for
sample 1 and 2. Decreasing contrast in the fringes corresponds to the loss of phase coherence with time. The ﬁt
to an exponential sinusoidal decay of the fringes revealed
the T ∗
2 of 4.4 and 4.9 µs for qubit 1 and 2, respectively
and we show the latter in the inset to Fig. 4(d). It is
expected that this low value of T ∗
2 is limited by thermal
noise injected into our measurement setup [43].
VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In conclusion, in this study we ﬁnd a method to fabricate high quality transmons using advanced optical
lithography. Our JJs are formed over a ﬁeld which is approximately an order of magnitude larger than JJs made
with the previous method of fabrication, which is e-beam
lithography, but they have similar variability. Additionally, our technique uses 193 nm lithography from 300 mm
wafers, and should ultimately provide beneﬁts over 248
nm lithography on 200 mm wafers, although the JJs fabricated with the latter are fabricated diﬀerently. A standard deviation of only 0.78% from 220 nm width line is
found across the central 176 mm × 130 mm on 300 mm
wafers. JJ statistical tests where performed on 25 mm ×
16 mm ﬁelds. For the JJ array portion of these chips the
standard deviation in resistance is 2.8−3.6%. Two qubits
were studied in the time domain. They had a diﬀerence
in 0-1 transition frequency of 1.33%, a value consistent
with the JJ statistics on resistance. Furthermore, they
exhibit relaxation times of T1= 26–27 µs. We conclude
that the defects in the bulk Si and fabricated ﬁlms are
comparable to state-of-the-art transmons on silicon. In
the future we plan to extend the coherence time to over
100 µs while demonstrating further uniformity improvements in JJs for qubits.
