Abstract
In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit
(IC) processes play a vital role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current
studies emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the integration of defect
characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC handling. To leverage
AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative approach for optimizing task assignment
in IC testing.
DeCo constructs a novel defectaware graph from IC testing reports, capturing cofailure relationships to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced by local and global
structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a contrasting-based assignment mechanism
pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by considering their skill level and current workload, thus
promoting an equitable and efficient job dispatch.
Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different scenarios, exceeding 80%,
while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data.
Moreover, case
studies reveal that DeCo can assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven
solution for the real-world IC failure analysis and
task handling.

Introduction
As the demand for integrated circuits (ICs) continues to grow
across numerous specialized sectors, it is essential in the
semiconductor industry to minimize the time from production to shipment while maintaining quality at every stage.
When manufacturers produce and deliver samples to customers, they receive numerous return material authorizations
Figure 1: The RMA processing flow.
(RMAs) [K et al., 2023]. RMAs play a crucial role in the development of the next IC phase, as customer-reported issues
are analyzed by the quality assurance (QA) and test verification teams. Addressing these issues directly affects IC design
improvements and production efficiency, making RMA handling a key competitive factor.
The RMA handling process is shown in Figure 1. In the
testing department, RMA first undergoes golden version testing through the automatic test equipment (ATE) [Lee et al.,
2003], where each RMA is regarded as a unique task assigned to an engineer. The ATE generates a test report (ATE
logs) containing results for various test items. Engineers analyze these reports to identify IC defect types, using historical RMA records and experience to diagnose the root cause.
Once determined, they report findings to the QA team, aiding
IC design improvements.
Current studies concentrate on automating fault localization within IC testing [Fan et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2023],
with the goal of pinpointing potential fault locations or defect
types during manufacturing, or improving the detection yield
during the design phase to reduce both cost and time [He and
Wang, 2007; Lang et al., 2022]. However, focusing solely on
fault localization may lead to critical limitations. ❶Specifically, certain defect types exhibit similar failure characteristics, and when defect data are scarce, identifying them becomes inherently challenging. As such, relying solely on automated fault localization is inadequate, as it does not utilize
contextual insights from previous cases. Engineers with prior
experience in similar failure scenarios are still often required
to ensure accurate defect diagnosis. ❷In additions, existing approaches overlook the structural relationships between

defects, historical failure logs, and engineers’ workload and
expertise, which hinder effective RMA handling by leading
to suboptimal task assignments and inefficient defect resolution. These limitations reveal a research gap: existing work
focuses on defect detection, but lacks research on optimizing
RMA handling to reduce manual diagnosis time and enhance
task allocation efficiency as shown in Figure 1.
Addressing this gap is essential for reducing resolution
time and enhancing overall IC testing workflows.
To address the identified challenges and enhance RMA handling, we propose DeCo (Defect-Aware Modeling with
Contrasting Matching), a novel framework designed to optimize RMA task assignment by maximizing task-handling
success rates, while ensuring engineer workloads remain
manageable. Specifically, to overcome the first limitation,
we design a defect-aware graph based on ATE logs of
each RMA task, structuring co-failure relationships among
RMAs. This graph structure encodes hidden dependencies
among defects, enabling more accurate defect differentiation even when ATE logs for defect types are scarce. Additionally, we formulate defect-aware representations for
engineers and RMA tasks based on their relationships with
defect types.
To further reinforce representations, we design local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware
graph, effectively capturing failure characteristics. These two
modeling approaches can be deployed independently or integrated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of
defect characteristics, directly addressing the second limitation. Finally, a contrasting-based assignment is introduced
to match new RMA tasks with the most suitable engineers
based on their representations and engineers’ current workloads, ensuring optimal task assignment and improving overall efficiency in RMA handling.
Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
• We introduce DeCo, a novel framework for optimizing
RMA task assignment, maximizing task-handling success
rates while balancing engineer workloads.
• To capture the failure characteristics of RMA tasks, we
construct a defect-aware graph and design both local and
global structure modeling to improve defect-aware task
representations, using a contrastive-based mechanism to refine task-to-engineer assignments.
• We evaluate DeCo on a real-world dataset under both
scarce and expanded ATE log conditions. Results demonstrate that DeCo achieves the highest success rate while

keeping workloads manageable across different simulation
scenarios, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for intelligent IC failure analysis and RMA handling.

Preliminaries
2.1
Data Analysis
Real-World Dataset
For this study, we use real data from a semiconductor company, including RMAs for IC failures and corresponding ATE
logs from 2020 to 2023, handled by four engineers.
Table 1 lists key data fields, with certain fields (e.g., rma.id,
rma.eng, test.id) anonymized. Engineers categorize RMAs
into defect.type after analyzing ATE log results. Each ATE
log contains multiple test items and their normal test range
(limit.min). An RMA fails a test item if its measured value
(measure) exceeds the normal range.
Analysis on Failure Characteristics
We perform a preliminary data analysis to validate that different defect types may share similar failure characteristics,
as mentioned in Sec. 1. Figure 2 shows the fail rate of each
test name across defect types in all ATE logs. While fail rates
vary, some defect types exhibit similar failure characteristics,
whereas others differ significantly.
Similar Characteristics. Defect types “#BEOL_defect” and
“#MIM_capacitor” (highlighted by the red dotted line in Figure 2) exhibit nearly zero fail rates between test indices 33
to 43 and share similar fail rate distributions in other regions,
particularly in indices 24 to 33. “#MIM_capacitor” refers

===== Page 3 =====

to issues in metal-insulator-metal capacitors, such as capacitance deviations or dielectric defects, while “#BEOL_defect”
involves back-end-of-line manufacturing problems, including
metal interconnect failures, via defects, or material delamination. The similarities between these two defect types arise
from their shared origins in manufacturing challenges, such
as material impurities, process misalignments, or contamination, which can lead to comparable failure characteristics.
Dissimilar Characteristics. Some defect types exhibit distinct failure characteristics.
Specifically, “#FEOL_defect”
and “#MOL_defect” (highlighted by the blue dotted line
in Figure 2) show substantial differences in fail rate distributions.
“#FEOL_defect” has higher fail rates at indices 30 to 43, while “#MOL_defect” is significantly higher
at indices 12, 16, and 24.
This discrepancy arises because the type “#FEOL_defect” occurs in the Front-End-OfLine (FEOL) stage, affecting transistor performance, whereas
“#MOL_defect” originates in the Middle-Of-Line (MOL)
stage, impacting signal transmission and interconnect resistance. As these defects arise at different manufacturing
stages, their failure characteristics differ.
This finding shows that defect types vary in their associations with failure characteristics. Capturing these characteristics in ATE logs is crucial for assigning RMA tasks
to suitable engineers. Accurate task matching not only enhances successful task handling but also reducing inefficiencies from misassignments, helping minimize the overall
workload needed to complete all tasks.
2.2
Problem Definition
Definition 1 (Task): In this study, each RMA initiated by a
customer is regarded as an unique task that requires handling.
The set of tasks is denoted as Vtask.
Problem Statement:
Given a set of tasks Vtask and
a set of engineers E, each task t
∈
Vtask is associated with its ATE log testing results and defect type, and
each engineer e ∈E has records of previously handled
RMAs. Note that new RMA tasks arrive sequentially and
are deemed successfully accomplished if they are finished
prior to their designated close dates (variable rma.close in
Table 1). Our goal is to assign new tasks to appropriate engineers to maximize the success rate while ensuring workloads
remain manageable1.

Proposed Method: DeCo
The architecture of DeCo comprises two main components.
First, we formulate representations for engineers and RMA
tasks based on their relationships with defect types.
Simultaneously, local and global structure modeling are employed to better capture the failure characteristics in ATE logs
(Sec. 3.1). Using these representations, the assignment of
each engineer to a new RMA task is determined through a
contrastive approach to identify the most appropriate task assignment plan (Sec. 3.2).
1“Success Rate” and “Workload” are defined as the ratio of successfully accomplished tasks and the average number of tasks handled per engineer, respectively. For ease of presentation, details are
described in Sec. 4.1.
Figure 3: Defect-aware graph construction from ATE logs.
3.1
Defect-Aware Representation
Engineer Representation
To evaluate the ability of each engineer in handling different
defect types of ICs, we first formulate the normalized representation ¯ei for each engineer ei ∈E, utilizing the data
from RMAs they have previously handled. Given the defect
type set Vtype, let Pi,p and Ni,p denote the average processing
time and the count of defect type p ∈Vtype handled by engineer ei ∈E, respectively. An engineer ei’s ability to handle
defect type p is defined as follows, where shorter processing
time and more handling experience indicate higher ability:
ability(i, p) = avg

1 −
Pi,p
P
ej Pj,p/|E| ,
Ni,p
P
ej Nj,p/|E|

.
(1)
Based on the defined ability ai,p of engineer ei, the normalized defect-aware representation ¯ei ∈R|Vtype| of engineer ei
is formulated as follows:
¯ei =
"
ability(i, p)
P
p′ ability(i, p′)
#
p∈Vtype
.
(2)
Task Representation
To preserve ATE log information and represent new tasks, we
construct a defect-aware graph based on ATE logs and encode
each node within it to capture failure characteristics.
Definition 2 (Defect-Aware Graph): Given the task set
Vtask, defect type set Vtype, and the test item set Vtest, the
relationships between these entities are defined as follows. If
a test item m ∈Vtest fails in the ATE logs of task t ∈Vtask,
an edge εm↔t is formed, defining the edge set Etest↔task =
{εm↔t | m ∈Vtest, t ∈Vtask}. If a task t ∈Vtask belongs
to defect type p ∈Vtype, an edge εt↔p is formed, defining
the edge set Etask↔type = {εt↔p | t ∈Vtask, p ∈Vtype}.
Therefore, the defect-aware graph G is formulated as follows:
G = (V, E, X)



V = Vtest ∪Vtask ∪Vtype (nodes)
E = Etest↔task ∪Etask↔type (edges)
X = {xv|v ∈V} (attributes)
,
(3)
where X is an attribute set, and each xv ∈X represents a
node attribute of “test item”, “task” or “defect type”. Figure 3
illustrates an example of graph construction.

===== Page 4 =====

The observation in Figure 2 highlights that different defect types exhibit varying degrees of correlation in their failure characteristics. To effectively capture these characteristics and encode each node in the defect-aware graph G, we
design two types of modeling approaches: local structure
modeling and global structure modeling. These approaches
can be applied individually or in combination. Generally, integrating both improves performance by capturing diverse
structural information. In some cases, such as when ATE
logs are extensive, global structure modeling alone better captures high-level defect relationships since it leverages broader
connections. Conversely, local structure modeling alone may
yield better results. By flexibly applying local and global
structural information, DeCo can provide a more comprehensive representation of defect-aware relationships.
Local structure modeling. For local structure modeling, we
represent the characteristics of each node in the defect-aware
graph G by exploring its local neighborhood. This allows us
to encode fine-grained, proximity-based relationships among
test items, tasks, and defect types. To achieve this, we redesign the classic model DeepWalk [Perozzi et al., 2014],
which learns node embeddings by generating random walks
over the graph and optimizing node co-occurrence within local neighborhoods. Also, we extend the skip-gram architecture [Grover and Leskovec, 2016; Mikolov et al., 2013] by
considering the second-order proximity [Tang et al., 2015]
of each node in defect-aware graph G = (V, E, X) to better
capture structural proximity. The objective function of local
structure modeling is designed as follows:
Olocal = −log Zu +
X
v∈N(u)


, if v ̸= u and v, u ∈Vtask
0
, otherwise
,
(5)
where Zu = P
u∈V exp(ψ(v) · ψ(u)), and N(u) refers to th
set of nodes in the random walk starting from u. The function J(N(v), N(u)) denotes the Jaccard similarity between
N(v) ∩Vtest and N(u) ∩Vtest. ψ(v) ∈Rd and ψ(u) ∈Rd
are embedding vectors of nodes v and u, respectively.
Global structure modeling. For global structure modeling,
unlike direct neighborhood relationships, we construct metapaths to traverse multiple intermediate nodes, uncovering
high-level relational dependencies. A metapath is an ordered
sequence of node types and edge types defined on the network
schema. These structures are specifically designed to reveal
high-level relational dependencies. The metapaths used in
our work are defined as:
Definition 3 (Metapath): We define a metapath P as a path
in the form of u(n0)
e1
→n1
e2
→...
el→v(nl), where ej ∈E,
and u and v belong to the same node set, i.e., both are from
test items (Vtest), tasks (Vtask), or defect types (Vtype). The
intermediate nodes {n1, ..., nl−1} belong to the remaining
node sets. For example, if u, v ∈Vtype, the intermediate
nodes satisfy {n1, . . . , nl−1} ⊂Vtask ∪Vtest. The metapath
describes a composite relationship π = e1 ◦n1 ◦e2 ◦... ◦el
between node u and v, where ◦denote the composition operator that sequentially connects edges and intermediate nodes
in G. Therefore, a metapath structure can be represented in a
triplet form P = (u, π, v).
To strengthen these structured dependencies, we create a
triplet-based representation and employ a margin-based objective to grasp the interconnections between the source node
u and the target node v within a metapath P = (u, π, v). This
approach facilitates the learning of representations for various
nodes in the defect-aware graph. Let P≤l
u,v denote all metapaths from u to v with a length of at most l ∈N. The objective
function of global structure modeling is defined as:
Oglobal = −

|P≤l
u,v|

P =(u,π,v)∈P≤l

LP =

h
EP + ξ −EP ′
i
+,
(7)
where P ′ is the set of negative samples generated based on
metapath P, and EP is a scoring function that evaluates the
plausibility of a metapath P. This function is derived from
the concept of knowledge graph embedding, ensuring that
the metapath (triplet structure) captures meaningful structural
relationships.
We employ the HolE model [Nickel et al.,
2016] as the scoring function for its effectiveness in capturing complex relational triplet structures. Here, [µ]+ denotes
max(0, µ), and ξ > 0 is a hyperparameter of margin.
The objective function for integrating both modeling approaches can be easily derived as:

where λ > 0 is a hyperparameter balancing both modeling.
Finally, the representation of each test item, task and defect
type in the defect-aware graph can be obtained.
Based on Eq. 8, we can formulate the representation of a
new task tk (/∈Vtask) by considering the failed test items in
its ATE logs. Let Fk ⊂Vtest includes the failed test items
in the ATE logs of new task tk. The probability of task tk
belongs to defect type p ∈Vtype is estimated as follows:

where ψ(·) represents the embedding vector of a node. The

3.2
Contrasting-Based Assignment
After obtaining the defect-aware representation ¯ei (Eq. 2) and
¯tk (Eq. 10) for each engineer ei and newly received task tk,
we aim to assign the most appropriate engineer to handle the
new task tk.
Here, we design the assignment score µi,k
to quantify the suitability of each engineer ei ∈E for new
task tk. Inspired by contrastive decoding approaches [Li et
al., 2022; Chuang et al., 2023], the assignment score µi,k is
computed by contrasting information across representations
¯tk and ¯ei to refine the task-to-engineer assignment process,
as designed as follows:
µi,k =
X
p∈Vtype
S(ei, tk, p),
(11)
S(ei, tk, p) =



log ¯ei(p) + ϵ
¯tk(p) + ϵ
, if Ni,p ̸= 0 and
wcurr
i
wavg
i
< 1
−∞
, otherwise
,
(12)
where ϵ > 0 is small constant introduced to prevent division
by zero. ¯ei(p) = ei,p represents the ability of engineer ei
for defect type p (Eq. 1, Eq. 2). ¯tk(p) = sk,p indicates the
probability that new task tk belongs to defect type p (Eq. 9,
Eq. 10). Ni,p denotes the number of tasks of defect type p
handled by engineer ei.
Specifically, to prevent excessive workload on engineers,
we introduce a workload constraint. The values wcurr
i
and
wavg
i
represent the current number of tasks handled by engineer ei and ei’s average historical workload, respectively.
The condition wcurr
i
/wavg
i
< 1 ensures that engineers with
lighter workloads are prioritized.
Finally, according to the assignment score µi,k for each
engineer ei ∈E and the new task tk, we assign task tk to the
engineer ˆe with the highest score, ensuring that the selected
engineer has sufficient capacity and a manageable workload
to handle the new task effectively.

Experiments
4.1
Experimental Setup
Dataset and Preprocessing.
We use a real-world ATE
dataset collected from a semiconductor company, as described in Sec. 2.1. To evaluate methods under both scarce
and informative defect data conditions, we consider the original dataset as scarce and create an expanded dataset by increasing the number of engineers, defect types, RMA logs
and other relevant factors. The statistics of the scarce (original) dataset and the expanded dataset are presented in Table 2.
The first 75% of the total RMA data is used for training, while
the remaining 25% is reserved for testing.
Baselines. We compare DeCo with the following baselines:
LowestWL, MostEXP, CF, as well as our variant CA. LowestWL and MostEXP are widely used strategies in industries.

Table 2: Dataset statistics.
• LowestWL assigns each new task to the engineer with the
lowest current workload.
• MostEXP assigns each new task to the engineer who has
handled the most tasks with similar failed test items, considering them the most experienced.
• CF employs collaborative filtering (CF). An engineertask matrix from past RMA records calculates suitability
scores. Similarity between a new task and past tasks uses
Word2Vec embeddings of failed test items, averaging these
embeddings to represent each task. An engineer’s suitability for a new task is a weighted sum of past task scores,
with weights from task cosine similarity.
• CA is a variant of DeCo retaining only contrast-based
assignment (remove defect-aware graphs). The new task’s
representation uses cosine similarity between fail rates of
test items in ATE logs and those of each defect type.
We also evaluate our method with local, global, and combined structure modeling, denoted as DeColocal, DeCoglobal,
and DeCo, respectively.
Evaluation Metrics. Our evaluation relies on two metrics:
• Success:
The
success
rate
(%)
is
the
ratio
of
tasks successfully completed by engineers, estimated as
|Nsuccess|/|Ntotal|, where Nsuccess is the set of tasks completed before their close dates, and Ntotal includes all new
tasks that need to be handled.
• Workload: The metric reports the average daily workload
per engineer, with lower values being better.
The daily
workload of each engineer is estimated as wt
i/wavg
i
, where
wt
i is the number of tasks handled by engineer ei on day t,
and wavg
i
is their average daily task count.
Engineer Processing Time Simulation.
To simulate the
time required for ei to handle the new task tk, we define an
influence factor x based on the current workload and experience. It is estimated as: x = (wcurr
i
/wavg
i
) + (Ni,p/N avg
i
),
where wcurr
i
and wavg
i
are the current and average number of
tasks handled by ei, respectively. Similarly, Ni,k is the number of times ei has handled tasks of the same defect type as
tk, and N avg
i
is the average number of times an engineer handles each defect type. Given the influence factor x, the time
Ti,k required for ei to handle the new task tk is as:
Ti,k = T avg
i,k + σ(κ · x −0.5)∆Ti,
(13)
where T avg
i,k
is the average time ei takes to handle tasks
of the same defect type as tk, and ∆Ti is the difference between the longest and shortest handling times for
ei. The parameter κ > 0 controls the impact of the influence
factor x, with a larger κ means a greater influence of workload and experience on the required time for handling tk.
Implementation details. For local structure modeling, the
walk length and number of walks are set to 20 and 10, respectively. For global structure modeling, the metapath length l is
set to 5 (Eq. 6), and the margin ξ is set to 1 (Eq. 7). In Eq. 8, λ
is set to 1, the embedding dimension to 128, and the training
epoch to 50. All experiments are conducted on a system with
12 CPU cores and 64GB RAM, running CUDA 12.1.

Results and Analysis
Comparison Results. Table 3 presents the comparative results under different engineer processing time settings, with
κ = 1, 2, 5 (Eq. 13). Key observations include:
Effectiveness. Our framework outperforms all baselines in
success rate, with the second-highest success rate also
achieved by DeCo variants (DeColocal, DeCoglobal, or DeCo).
Meanwhile, it maintains a competitive workload, demonstrating the effectiveness of capturing failure characteristics from
the defect-aware graph. Although LowestWL and CA perform similarly to our method on the ATEexp dataset, their
success rates remain lower across different κ values, while
their workload is only slightly lower.
Generalization. DeCo achieves the highest success rate while
keeping workloads manageable on both datasets. In ATEscar,
it significantly outperforms baselines, showing its applicability with limited data.
In ATEexp, although DeColocal,
DeCoglobal, and DeCo perform similarly, an interesting trend
emerges: when more ATE logs are available (ATEexp) and the
engineer processing time is more affected by workload and
experience (κ = 5), global structure modeling alone achieves
a higher success rate. This is because it captures broader
task relationships and engineer expertise, leading better task
assignments when data is abundant and processing time depends more on workload and experience.
Performance Analysis of Local and Global Modeling Integration. To evaluate the impact of integrating local and
global structure modeling in DeCo, we vary the λ value
(Eq. 8) to control the degree of integration, as shown in Figure 4. In dataset ATEscar, setting λ around 10−2 and 10−1
(where global modeling has less impact than local modeling)
achieves the highest success rate and lowest workload. In
dataset ATEexp, the success rate remains stable across different λ values, but setting λ to 101 yields the lowest workload.
Figure 4: The performance of DeCo with different values of λ.
This suggests that the expanded dataset contains richer information, allowing global modeling to better capture defect
relationships and assign tasks more accurately and efficiently.
Performance on Defect Type Detection. We further evaluate DeCo for defect type detection using defect-aware representations. In Eq. 9, prob(k, p) denotes the probability of task
tk belonging to defect type p. We select the top-3 and top-5
defect types with the highest prob(k, p) values as detection
results. Figure 5 presents the results, analyzing the impact of
varying walk length and margin in DeCo. Results indicate
that performance improves (stronger red) when both walk
length and margin are either smallest or largest. Longer walks
boost performance when the margin is 10, while a larger margin helps only at maximum walk length. This implies that
while longer walks capture more informative structures, they
require a larger margin to maintain proper separation in the

embedding space. Balancing these two factors can further
enhance performance.
Case study. To examine how DeCo assigns different tasks,
we present two cases where engineers successfully completed
tasks before close dates, as shown in Figure 6.
Case 1. Figure 6a shows a task of defect type “#EIPD”. Based
on the learned representation¯t of the task, DeCo correctly detects the defect type and assigns the task to Engineer A, whose
representation ¯e indicates the highest capability for handling
“#EIPD”. Engineer A also has the highest historical handling
ratio for this defect type. This case demonstrates that defectaware representations learned in DeCo can effectively capture
failure characteristics, enabling accurate defect detection and
task assignment to the most experienced engineers.
Case 2.
Figure
6b
shows
a
task
belonging
to
type
“#BEOL_defect”. As observed in Sec. 2.1, “#BEOL_defect”
shares similar failure characteristics with “#MIM_capacitor”.
This similarity causes the defect-aware representation ¯t to
predict a higher probability for “#MIM_capacitor” than
“#BEOL_defect”.
However, the contrasting-based assignment in DeCo identifies Engineer D as a suitable candidate. Even though Engineer D has no prior experience with
“#BEOL_defect”, the engineer’s defect-aware representation
¯e is similar to task¯t, indicating potential capability. This suggests that Engineer D’s experience with other defect types
provides transferable skills for handling this task. As a result,
DeCo assigns the task to Engineer D, who successfully completes it despite having no prior experience with this type.

Fault Localization.
Research on IC testing primarily focuses on optimizing test design in hardware design and manufacturing processes [Lang et al., 2022; Park et al., 2017;
Afacan et al., 2021; Lyu et al., 2018].
Machine learning
methods have been applied for fault detection and diagnosis during the thin film deposition stage [Fan et al., 2020].
VAE-based generative models have been used to address data

imbalance in thin film deposition [Fan et al., 2023]. Power
supply noise in ICs has also been detected and analyzed using ATE systems [Liau and Schmitt-Landsiedel, 2003].
Although existing works perform well in various scenarios, certain defects may exhibit similar failure characteristics,
making identification challenging. In such cases, accurate diagnosis often relies on experienced engineers. Therefore, our
work focuses on identifying IC failure characteristics and assign them to suitable engineers to improve defect handling.
This is an area still unexplored in IC test research.
Task Assignment.
Recent research focuses on effective
assignment while considering constrains [Mo et al., 2013;
Hettiachchi et al., 2022; Dickerson et al., 2018; Andersen et
al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Constantino et al., 2017]. Some research develops the QASCA system to support quality-aware
task assignment by incorporating worker skills and quality
standards [Zheng et al., 2015]. Various evaluation metrics
are also used depending on the task type [Li et al., 2014;
Lee et al., 2014; Balakrishnan et al., 2015; De Alfaro and
Shavlovsky, 2014]. Some studies have assessed the time required for workers to complete tasks [Mavridis et al., 2016],
while others have considered fairness among the population
under budget constraints [Goel and Faltings, 2019].
While these works address worker skills, task difficulty,
and efficiency, they often overlook worker workloads, a critical factor in practice. Our RMA task assignment addresses
this by considering engineer expertise, task failure characteristics, and workload balance while maximizing success rate
and ensuring practical applicability.

Conclusion
We propose DeCo, a framework for optimizing RMA task
assignment by constructing a defect-aware graph from ATE
logs and employing local and global structure modeling
to learn task representations. A contrast-based assignment
method refines task-to-engineer allocation. When applied to
real-world IC testing data, DeCo achieves the highest success rates while keepping engineers’ workloads manageable
across both scarce and expanded ATE log conditions. We also
demonstrate its effectiveness in defect type detection. Two
case studies show that DeCo can assign potentially capable
engineers to previously unfamiliar defects.
