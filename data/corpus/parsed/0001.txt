Faisal Mohammad, Duksan Ryu 
 
 Abstract— Semiconductor wafer defect classification is critical 
for ensuring high precision and yield in manufacturing. 
Traditional CNN-based models often struggle with class 
imbalances and recognition of the multiple overlapping defect 
types in wafer maps. To address these challenges, we propose 
ViT-Tiny, a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) framework 
optimized for wafer defect classification. Trained on the WM-38k 
dataset. ViT-Tiny outperforms its ViT-Base counterpart and 
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MSF-Trans and CNNbased architectures. Through extensive ablation studies, we 
determine that a patch size of 16 provides optimal performance. 
ViT-Tiny achieves an F1-score of 98.4%, surpassing MSF-Trans 
by 2.94% in four-defect classification, improving recall by 2.86% 
in two-defect classification, and increasing precision by 3.13% in 
three-defect 
classification. 
Additionally, 
it 
demonstrates 
enhanced robustness under limited labeled data conditions, 
making it a computationally efficient and reliable solution for 
real-world semiconductor defect detection.

I. INTRODUCTION 
emiconductor manufacturing is a highly complex 
process requiring precision at every stage. Defects in 
semiconductor wafers can lead to reduced yield, 
increased costs, and compromised product reliability [1]. 
Predicting these defects early in the production process is 
critical for ensuring quality and optimizing production 
efficiency.  
Semiconductors play a pivotal role in the technology 
industry, forming the backbone of modern electronics and 
powering a vast range of devices, from smartphones and 
laptops to advanced medical equipment and automobiles. The 
manufacturing of semiconductor devices is a highly intricate 
and precise process, requiring stringent quality control to 
ensure their functionality and reliability. However, even minor 
defects in semiconductor components can lead to significant 
performance degradation or outright failure of the devices, 
ultimately 
impacting 
product 
quality, 
manufacturing 
efficiency, and profitability. These defects represent a critical 
challenge, as the increasing complexity of semiconductor

designs and the demand for miniaturization amplify the 
likelihood of such issues. 
Addressing these limitations is vital to improving 
manufacturing yield and ensuring the consistent production of 
high-quality 
devices. 
Effective 
defect 
prediction 
and 
prevention strategies can minimize waste, optimize production 
processes, and enhance operational efficiency. Predicting 
defects during early manufacturing stages is particularly 
important, as it allows for timely interventions to mitigate 
errors, reduce costs, and maintain competitive advantage in 
the fast-paced semiconductor industry [2]. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative 
tool in predicting semiconductor defects. By analyzing large 
volumes of manufacturing data, including images from 
inspection tools, AI can detect patterns and anomalies that 
may 
be 
indicative 
of 
defects. 
Current 
research 
in 
semiconductor defect prediction has leveraged advanced AI 
techniques, such as deep learning and transfer learning, to 
classify and predict defects with improved accuracy. However, 
these methods often require substantial labeled datasets to 
achieve high performance, presenting a significant challenge 
given the limited availability of annotated data in 
semiconductor manufacturing [3], [4]. 
More 
recently, 
Transformer 
architectures, 
originally 
developed for natural language processing, have shown 
promise in time-series and tabular data analysis, providing 
novel ways to handle complex manufacturing datasets. Vision 
Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a groundbreaking 
approach in image processing, leveraging the self-attention 
mechanisms originally developed for natural language 
processing to analyze visual data [23]. By segmenting images 
into fixed-size patches and treating these as sequences, ViT 
can capture both local features and global contextual 
relationships without relying on the inductive biases inherent 
in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This architecture 
enables ViTs to model long-range dependencies within 
images, offering a more comprehensive understanding of 
complex visual patterns [29], [30], [31]  
Despite ongoing efforts, few studies have explored the 
potential of vision language models in semiconductor defect 
prediction. These approaches, which enable models to 
generalize from limited labeled examples, hold significant 
promise in addressing key challenges such as limited datasets, 
instantaneous defect prediction tasks, and imbalanced data 
distributions. By leveraging these cutting-edge methodologies, 
we aim to overcome the limitations of existing models and 
advance the field toward more efficient and robust defect 
prediction systems.

Here are four key contributions of our proposed framework: 
1) 
This study proposes a Vision Transformer-based 
framework for the semiconductor wafer map defect 
classification/detection/prediction. It demonstrates that 
ViT-Tiny, a lightweight variant of Vision Transformers, 
can 
achieve 
high 
classification 
accuracy 
while 
maintaining 
significantly 
lower 
computational 
complexity compared to ViT-Base.  
2) 
The approach demonstrates high per-class classification 
accuracy, ensuring reliable identification of various 
defect types. Unlike traditional methods that struggle 
with class imbalances, our fine-tuned ViT-Tiny 
consistently achieves strong precision, recall, and F1scores across all defect categories. 
3) 
Through an ablation study with multiple patch sizes, the 
research identifies that a patch size of 16 offers the best 
performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. 
This result highlights the ability of ViT-Tiny to 
effectively 
capture 
local 
defect 
patterns 
while 
maintaining a global context, ultimately surpassing ViTBase in classifying both single and mixed defect types. 
4) 
Experimental results prove that the proposed approach 
ensures robust performance across various defect 
categories (2, 3, or 4 overlapping defects), addressing 
challenges like class imbalance and intricate defect 
localization, which are crucial for semiconductor quality 
control. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Semiconductor 
defect 
prediction 
in 
semiconductor 
manufacturing has been a topic of significant research interest. 
Early works focused on traditional statistical methods and 
simple machine learning algorithms. For instance, researchers 
utilized decision trees and support vector machines to analyze 
process control data and identify correlations with defects. 
While these methods showed promise in structured datasets, 
their predictive performance was limited by their inability to 
handle high-dimensional and unstructured data, such as 
images or complex sensor outputs. 
In Table I semiconductor wafer defect classification has 
been extensively explored using machine learning (ML), deep 
learning (DL), and transformer-based approaches. Each of 
these methodologies has demonstrated strengths in tackling 
different challenges associated with defect classification, yet 
they also have limitations that impact their effectiveness, 
particularly when handling multi-label datasets such as WM38k. 
A. 
Machine Learning-Based Approaches 
Traditional ML techniques such as Random Forest (RF), 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other statistical learning 
methods have been widely used in semiconductor defect 
detection. These models, including those used in [7] and [8], 
rely heavily on handcrafted features and domain-specific 
knowledge. RF and SVM models perform well when feature 
extraction is straightforward, but they struggle with highdimensional and complex wafer defect patterns. Additionally, 
ML approaches suffer from scalability issues and require 
extensive feature engineering, making them less adaptable to 
diverse defect variations. Another major limitation is their 
inability to generalize well to new defect types, leading to 
lower accuracy in real-world applications. 
B. 
Deep Learning-Based Approaches 
DL-based models, such as CNNs [5], [6], [11], [25], [26], 
autoencoders, 
and 
hybrid 
networks 
[15], 
[27] 
have 
significantly improved defect classification accuracy by 
automatically learning hierarchical features. The use of 
encoder-decoder architectures and TransUNet [20] has 
facilitated better segmentation and mixed-type defect 
identification. However, these methods often require large 
amounts of labeled data and are prone to performance 
degradation when faced with class imbalances. Additionally, 
CNN-based models are limited in capturing long-range 
dependencies within wafer images, making them less effective 
for complex defect structures. Unlike ML methods, DL 
approaches minimize manual feature engineering but at the 
cost of higher computational requirements and potential 
overfitting to training data. 
C. 
Transformers-Based Approaches 
More recent research has explored transformers for defect 
classification due to their capability to process spatial 
dependencies effectively. Studies such as [17], [18], and [32] 
employ Transformers and attention mechanisms to enhance 
multi-scale defect recognition. Transformers-based models 
overcome CNN limitations by capturing global contextual 
relationships, making them more suitable for intricate wafer 
patterns. However, existing transformer-based approaches still 
face challenges in handling imbalanced datasets and multilabel classification. 
Therefore, Vision Transformer-based architecture for 
semiconductor wafer map defect classification has been 
proposed to deal with the multiclass and multi-labelled image 
data of the WM-38k dataset. Unlike previous studies, our 
approach efficiently handles both single-label and multi-label 
defect instances by capturing long-range dependencies and 
intricate feature representations. Additionally, by fine-tuning 
ViTs on WM-38k, superior classification performance 
compared to existing deep learning and transformer-based 
methods. The proposed method demonstrates robustness 
against class imbalances and effectively generalizes to unseen 
defect patterns, making it a more reliable solution for realworld semiconductor manufacturing processes. 
In summary, while artificial intelligence-based approaches 
have made significant advancements in semiconductor defect 
prediction, they often fall short in dealing with highdimensional wafer images, class imbalances, and multi-label 
classification. 
Our 
ViT-Tiny 
model 
addresses 
these 
limitations, providing an improved framework for accurate 
and scalable wafer defect detection. By optimizing the model 
for semiconductor wafer defect classification, the approach 
ensures that manufacturers can deploy ViT-Tiny in real-time  
detection pipelines without requiring extensive computational 
resources.

III. METHODOLOGY 
This work explores the methodology employed to design 
and implement a ViT-based model for predicting defects in 
semiconductor wafer maps. Unlike the other large vison model 
(LVM), which relies on convolutional layers for feature 
extraction, ViTs leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture 
long-range dependencies and spatial relationships within wafer 
images. This enables ViTs to model complex defect patterns 
more effectively, particularly in multi-label classification 
settings. The approach integrates supervised learning for welllabeled datasets to address scenarios with limited labeled data. 
The methodology is structured into key stages: dataset 
preparation, model architecture, training strategies, and 
evaluation metrics. 
 
A. 
Dataset Preprocessing 
Dataset preparation forms the foundation for training an 
effective ViT model. The semiconductor wafer map datasets were 
sourced from publicly available repositories and proprietary 
collections. These datasets encompass various defect patterns, 
including scratches, contamination, and structural irregularities 
that impact wafer quality. 
To ensure that the semiconductor wafer map defect images are 
correctly formatted for the ViT-based model to take input images 
with the appropriate size, the following preprocessing steps were 
applied: 
1). Data Splitting:  
  The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using an 
80:20 split to ensure a balanced representation of different defect 
categories. 
2). Data Normalization:  
  ViTs, unlike traditional CNNs, do not require convolutions for 
feature extraction. However, they still benefit from normalization 
and reshaping for optimal performance. To normalize the dataset, 
the pixel values are scaled between 0 and 1 for stable training. 
Then, the images are reshaped to match the input size expected by 
the ViT model. 
3). Resizing:  
  ViT require a fixed input size (224×224). Since the original 
wafer defect images might have different dimensions (e.g., 
52×52), they are resized using bilinear interpolation to match the 
ViT input size. 
4). Converting Grayscale to RGB:  
  Since Vision Transformers are pre-trained on RGB datasets (e.g., 
ImageNet), a 1×1 convolutional layer was used to convert singlechannel grayscale images into 3-channel RGB images. 
5). Augmentation:  
  Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and 
zooming were applied to enhance generalization and mitigate 
overfitting.

A. ViT-Tiny Model Architecture 
Generally, to process images using the Vision Transformer, 
each image is divided into fixed-size non-overlapping patches that 
are linearly embedded. A special [CLS] token is added to 
represent the entire image for classification. Absolute position 
embeddings are incorporated before feeding the sequence to a 
standard Transformer encoder. Since ViT requires a fixed image 
size, the ViTImageProcessor is used for resizing and 
normalizing images. The patch and image resolution used during 
training are reflected in the checkpoint names (e.g., vit-tinypatch16-224 for 16×16 patches and 224×224 image resolution). 
ViT models are pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (14M images, 
21k classes) and optionally fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k (1.3M 
images, 1k classes). While pre-training is done at 224×224 
resolution, 
fine-tuning 
at 
a 
higher 
resolution 
improves 
performance, achieved via 2D interpolation of position 
embeddings. Supervised pre-training yields the best results, unlike 
in NLP, where self-supervised learning is dominant. Experiments 
with masked patch prediction (like masked language modeling) 
improved performance, with ViT-B/16 achieving 79.9% accuracy 
on ImageNet, 2% better than training from scratch, but 4% lower 
than supervised pre-training. The ViT architecture for wafer defect 
classification due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies 
and global contextual information. The model architecture consists 
of: 
1). 
Patch Embedding 
Unlike CNNs that process images, ViT first divides an input 
image into fixed-size patches. Each patch is flattened into a vector 
and then passed through a linear projection layer to map it into a 
fixed-dimensional embedding. This step is like token embedding 
in NLP-based transformers. 
Mathematically, an input image 𝑥∈ℝ𝐻×𝑊×𝐶 where 𝐻 
and 𝑊denote the height and width of an image, and 𝐶 represents 
the number of channels. The ViT model splits the image into N 
patches, each with dimensions 𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ∈ ℝ𝐻×𝑃2×𝐶, where 𝑃 is the 
patch size. The total number of patches is calculated as 𝑁=
𝐻×𝑊
𝑃2 .  
2). 
Positional Encoding 
Since transformers lack inherent spatial awareness (unlike 
CNNs), positional encodings are added to each patch embedding. 
This encoding allows the model to understand the spatial structure 
of the image. The positional encoding is learnable or fixed and is 
added to the patch embeddings before feeding them into the 
transformer encoder. The input embedding 𝑍0 can given as:  
𝑍0 = 𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ+ 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠 
(1) 
 
where 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠 is the positional encoding matrix. 
3). 
Transformer Encoder 
Once the patch embeddings with positional encodings are 
formed, they are fed into a standard Transformer Encoder, which 
consists of: 
• 
Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA): Each patch embedding 
attends to every other patch using self-attention. The selfattention mechanism allows the model to capture global 
dependencies in the image. Multi-head attention improves 
feature extraction by attending to different parts of the image 
using different attention heads. 
Mathematically, self-attention is computed as: 
𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄𝐾𝑇
√𝑑𝑘
) 𝑉 
(2) 
where  𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉 are the query, key, and value matrices derived 
from the input patches. 
• 
Feedforward Network (FFN): A two-layer MLP processes 
the output of the attention module. the variable H represents 
the output of the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) 
activation function applied to the affine transformation of 
38

the input xxx. This transformation involves multiplying 
xxx by the weight matrix 𝑊 and adding the bias vector 𝑏1. 
This enhances the ability to learn complex features. 
Mathematically, it is represented in the equation 3 and 4:  
  
𝐻=  𝐺𝐸𝐿𝑈(𝑥𝑊1 + 𝑏1) 
(3) 
𝑌= 𝐻𝑊2 + 𝑏2 
(4) 
 
• 
Layer Normalization: Each attention and feed-forward block 
is wrapped with layer normalization and residual connections 
for stable training. 
𝑥̂𝑖= 𝑥𝑖−𝜇
𝜎+∈𝛾+ 𝛽 
(5) 
Where,  
𝑥̂𝑖→ The normalized output after layer normalization.  
𝑥𝑖→ The input feature (before normalization) for a given 
patch or token,  
𝜇→ The mean of the input features across the layer,  
𝜎→ The standard deviation of the input features across the 
layer,  
∈ → A small constant added for numerical stability (to 
prevent division by zero), 
𝛾→ A scaling parameter (learnable) that adjusts the 
normalized output,  
𝛽 → A shifting parameter (learnable) that allows the model to 
shift the normalized output.  
• 
Residual Connections: Residual connections (also called skip 
connections) allow the input of a layer to bypass 
transformations and be directly added to the output. This 
helps in training deep networks by mitigating the vanishing 
gradient problem. In ViTs, residual connections are applied 
inside each Transformer block, specifically: 
After Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) 
𝑧′ = 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑥+ 𝑀𝑆𝐴(𝑥)) 
(6) 
After the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) 
𝑦= 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑧′ + 𝐹𝐹𝑁(𝑧′)) 
(7) 
B. 
Algorithm  
Algorithm 1 explains the entire process of the ViT-based 
framework for the semiconductor wafer map defect detection. 
Step 1 is to split the dataset into the train and test. Step 2 
establishes the fundamental configuration of the ViT, like 
image size, patch size, number of transformer layers, etc. In 
step 3, further preprocessing is done, such as normalization and 
augmentation, followed by step 4, to convert the images into 
patches to transform the spatial structure of images into a 
sequence format, which is suitable for transformer processing. 
To apply the ViT model to image classification, the wafer map 
input image is first divided into multiple patches through a 
linear projection of flattened segments. Positional information 
is then added to these patches to aid in spatial recognition, 
done in step 5.

End Algorithm 
The transformer encoder in step 6 processes these patches, and 
its output is fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for 
classification, as depicted in Figure. 2. Initially, an input image 
𝑥∈ℝ𝐻×𝑊×𝐶is provided, for the wafer map dataset, the ViT 
model divides the image into 𝑁 patches, with 𝑃 being the side 
length of each patch. In this case, 𝑁 is set to 16, meaning the input 
image of size 𝐻× 𝑊 is partitioned into an 𝑛× 𝑛 grid, where 𝑁=
𝑛2. To balance computational efficiency and classification 
accuracy, an image size of 52 × 52 pixels was selected for the 
experiments in this study. Step 7 converts the processed sequence 
of patch embedding into the classification decisions. In this step, 
the multi-dimensional transformer output is flattened into a single 
vector which is then normalized and passed through a dense layer 
to output the final class scores typically followed by a softmax 
activation function to yield class probabilities.  Training is 
performed in step 8 in which model is compiled with an Adam 
optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function with the batch 
size of 64 over 30 epochs. Finally, the model evaluation is 
performed using the evaluation metrics to check the performance.

ides an overview of the ViT variants, ViT-Tiny is the best candida
te with the good computational efficiency with lower memory req
uirements and time required to train. Following are some key poin
ts about Vit-Tiny which distinguishes it from its other variants:  
1). 
Efficiency & Low Resource Requirements 
The ViT-Tiny model has significantly fewer parameters (~5.4M
) in the proposed model compared to the base model and other larg
er variants (but in the paper the number of parameters is same as s
hown the Table II). This translates to lower memory consumption 
and faster inference times, making it ideal for resource-constrained 
environments or real-time applications. 
2). 
Improved Accuracy  
Despite its smaller size, our experimental results indicate that th
e tiny variant not only meets but, in some cases, even improves up
on the accuracy achieved by larger models such as the base variant
, where there is the chance of underfitting the model. This could be 
due to better regularization and a model capacity that is well-matc
hed to the complexity of our dataset. 
3). 
Faster Training and Deployment 
With a reduced computational burden, training time is minimize
d, which is beneficial when quick iterations are needed. Additional
ly, production is simpler and more cost-effective when using a ligh
ter model. 
4). 
Suitability for Limited Data Scenario 
Smaller models tend to generalize better when the available data 
is limited, as they are less prone to overfitting. This makes ViT-Ti
ny particularly attractive for applications where collecting a large 
dataset is challenging. Overall, resource constraints and the observ
ed performance improvements, the proposed approach (ViT-Tinypatch16-224) emerges as a strong candidate, offering an excellent 
balance between efficiency and accuracy.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
A. Dataset 
The WM-38k dataset is a comprehensive collection of 
over 38,000 semiconductor wafer maps, systematically 
categorized into 38 defect patterns. These patterns include one 
normal pattern, several single-defect cases, and a variety of 
mixed defect types. This extensive dataset is used to 
benchmark and improve wafer defect detection models in 
semiconductor manufacturing. This data encompasses 38 
distinct defect patterns, categorized into four types depending 
upon the type of defects on the single wafer map as shown in 
Table III: 
• 
Single Type Defect Patterns: It contains one normal class 
and 8 classes with defect patterns, each depicting a unique 
type of defect occurring in isolation. 
• 
2-Mixed Type Defect Patterns: It contains 13 patterns 
illustrating combinations of two defect types on a single 
wafer. 
• 
3-Mixed Type Defect Pattern: It has 12 classes with each 
class depicting the combination of three defect types 
present on the single wafer  
• 
4-Mixed Type Defect Pattern: It consists of 4 different 
classes of wafer defect dataset. In each class the wafer 
map has 4 defect types.  
The dataset was curated to address the challenges posed by 
mixed-type defects, which are more complex to identify and 
classify due to the simultaneous presence of multiple defect 
types. The MixedWM38 dataset serves as a valuable resource 
for developing and benchmarking machine learning models 
aimed at accurate and efficient wafer defect pattern 
recognition, thereby aiding in diagnosing manufacturing issues 
and enhancing process yields in the semiconductor industry.

B. Experimental validation  
In this section, the performance of the proposed model is 
evaluated using the previously introduced dataset, which 
comprises a total of 38,015 wafer maps, as described above. To 
ensure a fair and robust evaluation, we randomly divided the 
dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% test set, ensuring 
diverse defect patterns were included in both partitions. 
The entire training and evaluation process have been 
conducted using Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.7.0 within the 
Google Colab environment, leveraging an NVIDIA T4 GPU. 
The model was trained using a batch size optimized for the 
hardware limitations while maintaining efficient convergence. 
The specific hyperparameter settings, including learning rate, 
weight decay, and optimizer choices. 
C. Baseline Models for Semiconductor Wafer Defect 
Classification 
To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed ViT-Tiny 
model, we compare its performance against several baseline 
models, including convolutional neural networks, transformerbased models, and hybrid deep learning architectures. These 
baselines represent state-of-the-art models commonly used for 
semiconductor defect detection. 
1) CNN-Based Models 
Traditional CNNs have been widely used in wafer defect 
classification due to their strong feature extraction capabilities. 
However, 
they 
struggle 
with 
capturing 
long-range 
dependencies in complex defect patterns. The CNN-based 
baselines include: 
• 
ResNet-50/101/152 – Deep residual networks that utilize 
skip connections to improve gradient flow [34]. 
• 
MobileNet-V3 – A lightweight CNN model optimized for 
mobile and embedded systems, offering faster inference 
[35]. 
• 
EfficientNet-B7 – A computationally optimized CNN 
model designed for high accuracy with fewer parameters 
[36]. 
• 
AlexNet – One of the earliest deep CNN architectures, 
primarily used as a historical reference in defect 
classification benchmarks [37]. 
2) Transformer-Based Models 
With the recent success of transformer architectures in 
vision tasks, several self-attention-based models have been 
applied to semiconductor defect detection. We include the 
following transformer-based baselines: 
• 
MSF-Trans – A multi-scale information fusion transformer 
that integrates attention across different scales to enhance 
defect classification. 
• 
Swin Transformer – A hierarchical transformer model that 
applies shifted window attention for better spatial feature 
extraction. 
• 
ViT-Base – A standard ViT model, serving as a baseline to 
compare against our lightweight ViT-Tiny variant. 
3) Hybrid Architectures 
Hybrid and deformable convolution-based architectures 
offer improvements over CNNs and transformers by 
introducing additional flexibility in feature extraction. We 
compare our model against: 
• 
DC-Net – A Deformable Convolutional Network that 
dynamically adapts convolutional filters to enhance defect 
detection. 
• 
ConvNext – A modernized CNN architecture designed to 
mimic the hierarchical feature learning of transformers 
while retaining CNN efficiency [38]. 
Unlike CNN-based models, ViT operates without the need 
for convolutional layers, instead leveraging self-attention 
mechanisms to model long-range dependencies across wafer 
maps. This architecture allows the model to capture complex 
spatial 
relationships, 
potentially 
leading 
to 
superior 
classification accuracy compared to conventional deep learning 
approaches. The results of this comparative study provide 
insights into the strengths and limitations of each model in 
semiconductor defect detection, helping to identify the most 
effective architecture for this task. 
D. Evaluation Metrics 
Evaluating the performance of a wafer defect detection model 
requires a set of robust metrics that measure classification 
accuracy, model reliability, and practical applicability. The 
following are key evaluation metrics commonly used for this task: 
1) Confusion matrix 
   It provides a detailed breakdown of model predictions, showing 
TP, TN, FP, and FN counts. It helps visualize performance across 
different defect categories.

2) Accuracy 
This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified 
wafer images out of the total number of samples. It is a simple and 
widely used metric for evaluating classification models. 
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 
𝑇𝑃+ 𝑇𝑁
𝑇𝑃+ 𝑇𝑁+ 𝐹𝑃+ 𝐹𝑁 
(8) 
Where: 
• 
TP (True Positive): Defective wafers correctly classified 
as defective 
• 
TN (True Negative): Normal wafers correctly classified 
as normal 
• 
FP (False Positive): Normal wafers misclassified as 
defective 
• 
FN (False Negative): Defective wafers misclassified as 
normal 
3) Precision (Positive Predictive Value - PPV) 
Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted 
defective wafers out of all instances classified as defective. It is 
crucial when false positives need to be minimized. 
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛= 
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑃 
(9) 
 
4) Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate - TPR) 
Recall measures the proportion of actual defective wafers that 
the model correctly identified.  
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙= 
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑁 
(10) 
 
5) F1-Score 
The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, 
providing a balanced measure when both false positives and false 
negatives are important. It is useful when there is an imbalance 
between defective and non-defective wafers. 
𝐹1 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒= 2 × 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛× 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+ 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 
(11) 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. RQ1: Does the Proposed Approach outperform the SOTA 
Large Vision Models? 
The proposed approach employing the ViT-Tiny model 
performs better than state-of-the-art large vision models trained 
on the wafer defect dataset. The current SOTA large vision 
models like ConvNext, ResNet, MobileNet-V3, EfficientNetB7, and AlexNet trained on the ImageNet. Further, some more 
models for the comparison have been added which are domain 
specific for the semiconductor wafer map defect classification 
like MSF-Trans, Swin Transformers, and DC-Net. All of the 
above models are outperformed by the proposed approach 
using ViT-Tiny and the results in terms of training accuracy 
and validation accuracy are depicted in the Table V. The ViTTiny variant achieved a training accuracy of 99.7% and a 
validation accuracy of 98.4%. This outperforms all other 
models evaluated, which reported validation accuracies ranging 
from 82.5% to 97.5%.

1). Enhanced Accuracy:  
The ViT-Tiny model exhibits a notable improvement in 
validation accuracy, achieving 98.4%, which is an absolute 
increase of 1.0% over the next best model Swin Transformers 
and MSF-Trans). Compared to traditional CNN architectures 
such as ResNet variants, the improvement ranges from 
approximately 1.6% (ResNet 50) to 2.8% (ResNet 101 and 
ResNet 152). Even against lightweight architectures like 
MobileNet-V3, the improvement is substantial, with ViT-Tiny 
outperforming by over 15%. 
2). Efficiency and Computational Advantage:  
Despite having a considerably smaller parameter footprint 
than larger ViT variants, the ViT-Tiny model can capture 
essential features for wafer defect detection. Its computational 
efficiency not only facilitates faster training and inference but 
also minimizes resource requirements, making it an ideal choice 
for real-time industrial applications. 
3). Generalization Capability:  
The high training and validation accuracies, with only a 
marginal gap between them, indicate that the proposed ViTTiny model is well-regularized and effectively generalizes 
unseen data. This is particularly critical in the context of wafer 
defect detection, where data variability and limited training 
samples are common challenges. 
In summary, the ViT-Tiny model delivers a balanced 
combination of high accuracy, computational efficiency, and 
robust generalization, thereby positioning it as a superior 
alternative to larger vision models for our wafer defect 
classification task also reported in Figure. 4 using confusion 
matrix.

B. RQ2: Can a computationally efficient Vision Transformer 
(ViT-Tiny) improve semiconductor defect classification 
accuracy compared to other Transformer-based models? 
While performing experiments on the WM-38k Mixed wa
fer map defect dataset to achieve better values for the evaluatio
n metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, the pro
posed approach showed excellent results while outperforming t
he SOTA methods. The whole scenario can be analyzed in ter
ms of accuracy in Figure 3 and in terms precision, recall, and F
1-Score in Table VI. 
1). 
Single Defect (Classes 0–8) 
ViT-Tiny consistently achieves near-perfect precision and 
recall in these classes (e.g., Classes 0, 6, 8 often reach F1-Score 
= 1.00). ViT-Base also performs extremely well, typically 
exceeding 0.98–0.99 F1-Score. MSF-Trans performs well on 
most single-defect classes but notably struggles with Class 8 
(Recall ~81.25%, F1 ~0.88), indicating difficulty in capturing 
the visual nuances of that specific defect pattern. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 0–8): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9917 
→ ViT-Base: ~0.9894 
→ MSF-Trans: ~0.9693 
Hence, ViT-Tiny is about +0.23% above ViT and +2.24%  
above MSF-Trans in average F1 for single-defect classes. 
2). 
2-Mixed Type Defects (Classes 9–22) 
Both ViT-Tiny and ViT achieve F1 scores in the 0.97–0.99 
range across most classes (e.g., Classes 10, 11, 17, 20, etc.). 
MSF-Trans remains competitive but shows slightly lower F1 
values, typically around 0.95–0.98 for many two-defect classes. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 9–22): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9824 
→ ViT-Base: ~0.9825 
→ MSF-Trans: ~0.9761 
ViT-Tiny and ViT-Base are essentially tied, with only a 
~0.01% difference. However, ViT-Tiny still leads MSF-Trans 
by +0.63% on average. 
3). 
3-Mixed Type Defects (Classes 23–33) 
ViT-Tiny outperforms both ViT-Base and MSF-Trans by a 
more noticeable margin. Classes 23 and 25 are prime examples, 
where ViT-Tiny consistently hits or nears 1.00 F1, while MSFTrans lingers slightly lower. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 23–33): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9828 
→ ViT-Base: ~0.9765 
→ MSF-Trans: ~0.9653 
Here, ViT-Tiny shows +0.63% improvement over ViT-Base 
and +1.75% over MSF-Trans. 
4). 
4-Mixed Type Classes (34–37) 
Classes 34–37 often have slightly more complex or less 
frequent defect patterns. ViT-Tiny maintains high F1 scores 
(~0.97–0.98), while ViT hovers around 0.96–0.97, and MSFTrans dips further for certain classes. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 34–37): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9767 
→ ViT-Base: ~0.9701 
→ MSF-Trans: ~0.9473 
In this group, ViT-Tiny is +0.66% above ViT and +2.94% 
above MSF-Trans. 
C. Does the ViT-Tiny outperformed CNN-based Large Vision 
Models in single and mixed defect classification?  
ViT-Tiny demonstrated superior performance compared to 
state-of-the-art CNN models, including EfficientNet-B7, 
MobileNet-V3, ConvNext, and ResNet-50. The results indicate 
significant improvements across different defect categories.

1). 
Single Defect (Classes 0–8) 
ViT-Tiny consistently achieves near-perfect precision and 
recall in these classes. It maintains F1-Scores close to 1.00 
across multiple single-defect classes, particularly excelling in 
classes where CNN-based models struggle to capture finegrained defect patterns. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 0–8): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9917 
→ EfficientNet-B7: ~0.906 
→ MobileNet-V3: ~0.825 
→ ConvNext: ~0.897 
→ ResNet-50: ~0.953 
ViT-Tiny 
outperforms 
EfficientNet-B7 
by 
+8.57%, 
MobileNet-V3 by +16.67%, ConvNext by +9.46%, and 
ResNet-50 by +3.88% in terms of average F1-score for singledefect classification. 
2). 
2- Mixed Type Defects (Classes 9–22) 
In two-defect scenarios, ViT-Tiny maintains F1-Scores in the 
0.97–0.99 range, significantly outperforming CNN-based 
models, which show a more substantial drop in recall due to 
increased defect complexity. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 9–22): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9824 
→ EfficientNet-B7: ~0.906 
→ MobileNet-V3: ~0.825 
→ ConvNext: ~0.897 
→ ResNet-50: ~0.954 
ViT-Tiny surpasses EfficientNet-B7 by +7.63%, MobileNetV3 by +15.74%, ConvNext by +9.51%, and ResNet-50 by 
+2.86% in two-defect classification. 
3). 
3-Mixed Type Defects (Classes 23–33) 
With three mixed defect types, ViT-Tiny retains an advantage 
by capturing defect variations that CNN models fail to 
generalize. It consistently achieves higher precision and recall, 
especially in complex defect patterns. 
Quantitative Improvements (Average F1, Classes 23–33): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9828 
→ EfficientNet-B7: ~0.906 
→ MobileNet-V3: ~0.825 
→ ConvNext: ~0.897 
→ ResNet-50: ~0.953 
ViT-Tiny achieves +7.63% higher F1-score than EfficientNetB7, +15.74% over MobileNet-V3, +9.55% over ConvNext, and 
+3.13% over ResNet-50. 
4). 
4-Mixed Type Defects (Classes 34–37) 
ViT-Tiny maintains superior F1-Scores while CNN models 
exhibit lower recall, particularly in rare or ambiguous defect 
cases. 
Improvements (Average F1, Classes 34–37): 
→ ViT-Tiny: ~0.9767 
→ EfficientNet-B7: ~0.906 
→ MobileNet-V3: ~0.825 
→ ConvNext: ~0.897 
→ ResNet-50: ~0.953 
ViT-Tiny outperforms EfficientNet-B7, MobileNet-V3 , 
ConvNext, and ResNet-50 by +7.79%, +15.99%, +8.90% and 
+2.49% respectively. 
D. 
Ablation Study:  
 To thoroughly evaluate the impact of architectural and tra
ining hyperparameters on the performance of ViT-Tiny for sem
iconductor defect classification, we conducted an ablation stud
y by varying two key factors. Our experimental results demons
trated that: 
1) Patch size:  
Leveraging the patch size of 16 maintained a balance 
between feature extraction and computational cost, achieving 
stable learning while preserving important defect features. 
While as patch size of 8 increased spatial granularity but 
resulted in higher computational overhead and slower 
convergence without significant accuracy gains. 
2) Batch Size: 
Similarly, experiment with batch sizes 16, 32, and 64. 
Small batch sizes (16, 32) led to noisier updates and slower 
convergence. Large batch sizes (128) improved stability but 
required more memory and did not significantly enhance 
accuracy. Batch size 64 provided the best trade-off between 
stability, convergence speed, and computational efficiency.

V. THREATS TO VALIDITY 
A. Internal Validity 
This work has one potential threat to internal validity is 
the reliance on the WM-38k dataset, which may not fully 
represent all possible semiconductor defect variations. While 
data augmentation helps mitigate this, biases in the dataset 
could influence the model’s generalization. Another concern is 
hyperparameter selection, as fine-tuning ViT-Tiny on specific 
configurations may lead to performance variations across 
different settings. Without extensive cross-validation or 
additional independent test sets, the reported accuracy may not 
fully reflect real-world model performance. 
B. External Validity 
The generalizability of ViT-Tiny beyond the WM-38k 
dataset remains a concern, as real-world semiconductor defect 
distributions 
may 
differ. 
Additionally, 
the 
model’s 
performance in unseen manufacturing environments with 
varying imaging conditions and noise levels is uncertain. 
Further testing on diverse datasets and industrial settings is 
needed to confirm its robustness.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
Semiconductor defect detection is a fundamental challenge 
in modern manufacturing, where precision, efficiency, and 
scalability are crucial to maintaining high production yield and 
quality assurance. In this study, we explored Large Vision 
Models (LVMs) for semiconductor defect classification and 
proposed an optimized ViT-Tiny-based framework that 
effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach leverages 
domain-specific fine-tuning of the pretrained ViT-Tiny model, 
which significantly reduces space and time complexity while 
maintaining overall high classification F1-Score 98.4%. 
Unlike larger ViT variants and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) 
methods, ViT-Tiny demonstrates a more computationally 
efficient architecture, making it a viable solution for industrial 
applications where real-time defect detection is critical. 
Through extensive experimentation, our framework achieves 
remarkable 
per-class 
classification 
accuracy, 
F1-score, 
precision and recall, outperforming existing techniques in 
recognizing both single-defect and mixed-defect types, 
particularly 2-, 3-, and 4-mixed defects. These results 
demonstrate the model's robustness in handling complex 
defect patterns, which is a key requirement in semiconductor 
manufacturing.  
Future research directions include further optimizing the 
ViT-Tiny architecture for even lower computational overhead, 
investigating its applicability to other industrial defect 
detection tasks, and exploring multimodal learning techniques 
that incorporate additional sensor data and image description 
as an additional modality to enhance classification accuracy.
