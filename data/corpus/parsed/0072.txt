Abstract 
Inert (noble gas) elements are extremely inactive to surrounding chemical environment 
and are frequently employed as protective gas in various semiconductor fabrication 
processes. In this work, we surprisingly discover that high doses of argon up to 10171020 cm-3 can be measured in silicon exposed by laser pulses even after 1300 days. Firstprinciples calculations and molecular dynamics identify a unique argon-lockingvacancy (ALV) defect atomic model in silicon. The ALV defect is dynamically robust 
in contrast to the frequently moving pure Si vacancy. While argon is chemically inert, 
it readily modulates defect states of the occupied vacancy via steric repulsion and 
rattling motions, leading to significant band splitting within bandgap and thus strong 
infrared absorptions. Moreover, the repulsion between substitutional argon and 
dangling bonds results in shallow donors which explains the confusion of enhanced ntype carriers in experiments. The work paves a way of using noble gas element to 
produce active infrared absorption source for the non-heteroepitaxy photonic detectors 
directly on silicon wafer at infrared communication wavelength.

Silicon (Si) based optoelectronic devices is at the heart of optoelectronic industry owing 
to their ability for Si integration. Among them, photodetectors working at infrared (IR) 
communication wavelength (λ) of 1.31/1.55 μm are indispensable. However, due to the 
well-known problem of low absorption at λ ≥ 1.1 μm, corresponding to the Si bandgap, 
Si is powerless in communication applications. Often, a different semiconductor with a 
suitable bandgap is heterogeneously grown on Si. However, issues with heteroepitaxy 
such as lattice mismatch can reduce or even degrade the performance of the detectors 
[1]. Another way is to introduce IR absorption sources in Si. For example, gap states 
can be created inside Si by chalcogenide dopants with the help of ultrafast laser pulses 
to result in doped black silicon [2-6]. It has a strong IR absorption at λ = 1.31/1.55 μm. 
However, such IR sources are often not stable enough for applications. For example, 
the IR absorption at 1.31/1.55 μm in black silicon can be significantly reduced by 
annealing at 775 K for half an hour [4]. 
 
In 2018, Zhao et al. reported a form of black Si, which was fabricated by nanosecond 
laser pulses without any intentional element dopant except for a protective Ar gas [7,8]. 
It was quite unexpected that the photodiode fabricated based on such a black Si has a 
high and stable photoresponsivity of 260 mA/W at 5 V at λ  =  1.31 μm [8], which paves 
the way for practical sensing by a Si detector at the IR communication wavelength. 
Argon is a noble gas widely used as a protective gas in the electronic industry.  As a 
matter of fact, the name of argon is derived from a Greek word that means lazy or 
inactive. Due to its fully occupied valence band electronic shell with eight electrons, 
there is little chemical reaction between argon and other elements. As such, it is also 
expected that the Ar gas has no effect on the property of semiconductors. 
 
In this work, we report the observation of very high concentration of Ar (1017-1020 cm3) in ultrafast laser-modified Si using the secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) 
measurement. First-principles calculations and molecular dynamic studies reveal the 
unique atomic and electronic properties of the Ar-doped Si to result in an unexpected 
and strong IR absorptions. While the pure Si vacancy can produce dangling-bond state

within bandgap, it is movable and unstable. In contrast, Ar atom can lock the Si vacancy 
to form a dynamically stable defect complex even up to 900 K. Thanks to its full 
electronic shell, Ar protects the dangling electrons of vacancy and retains its gap states. 
Moreover, rattling motion and Coulomb repulsion of Ar atoms can lead to an enhanced 
structural distortion and the further splitting of defect energy levels within the bandgap. 
Unexpectedly, the repulsion between substitutional Ar and dangling electrons makes 
the defect a shallow donor, which explains the confusion of laser irradiation induced ntype doping effect. As a result, the inert Ar atom in fact acts as an electronic impurity 
and offers active and robust sub-bandgap IR absorption source for Si photodetector. 
This solves the long-term difficulty of high photoresponsivity of Si based detectors at 
IR communication wavelength. The physics behind shed new light on a general strategy 
of employing inert elements to raise performances of semiconductor devices. 
 
The concentrations of Ar atoms are measured by dynamic secondary ion mass 
spectrometer (D-SIMS) in laser modified Si samples in argon protecting atmosphere.  
The fabrication of such samples were reported in our previous work [8]. The D-SIMS 
instrument is equipped with a Cameca IMS-4F device using 8 keV Cs+ primary beam. 
Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using the VASP code 
[9,10], where the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudo potential and generalizedgradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation functional developed by Perdew, 
Burke and Ernzerh are adopted [11-13]. A Si supercell that contains 216 atoms are used 
to describe defect effects. The energy cutoff for plane-wave expansion is 380 eV. The 
3×3×3 Monkhorst-Pack grids are used as Brillouin-zone sampling for static energy and 
property calculations, while the Γ point is used for structural relaxation and molecular 
dynamic (MD) simulations. The band structures of supercells are unfolded by the 
modified VaspBandUnfolding package [14]. Energy barriers are calculated using the 
climbing image nudged elastic band (c-NEB) method [15,16]. The structures and 
charge density are visualized by the VESTA code [17]. The positions of vacancy defect 
are determined by the Wigner-Seitz method in the OVITO code [18].

To figure out the actual role of Ar atoms in laser modified Si, we carefully analyze the 
dose of Ar by SIMS measurements in this work. Figure 1(a) displays Ar concentration 
for such a typical Si sample, which was fabricated previously by nanosecond laser in 
Ar atmosphere [8]. It is unexpected that even the sample has been made over 1300 days, 
a very high dose of Ar atoms can be detected as from ~ 4×1021 cm-3 at the surface to ~ 
4×1017 cm-3 at 2 µm below the surface. We reevaluate the specific detectivity (D*) of 
the photodetector based on the Si sample [8] and compare it to those of non-silicon 
photodetectors at the IR wavelength of λ = 1.31 μm [19].  The 1.31-µm wavelength, 
whose photonic energy is below the bandgap of Si, is out of the detecting scope of 
detectors based on intrinsic Si. A higher D* reflects a higher signal-to-noise ratio of 
detectors. For example, Fig. 1(b) shows that the D* of the laser modified Si in Ar 
atmosphere here working at 295 K (1011 cmHz1/2W-1) is not only higher than those of 
PbSe and InAs working at the same temperature but also higher than or close to those 
of InAs and InSb working at a much lower temperature of 193 K or 77 K. All of these 
indicate the inclusion of Ar in Si could potentially offer a highly effective IR absorption 
source for detectors. 
 
To uncover the microscopic picture and critical role of Ar in Si samples, we carry out 
first-principles calculations. In fact, the formation energies (ΔHf) of Ar defects in 
crystalline Si are very large. Table S1 in Supplemental Material summarizes the 
calculated ΔHf of several defects in Si, which agrees with previous reports [20,21]. 
The calculated ΔHf of interstitial and substitutional Ar defects are as large as 6.05-7.19 
eV while the ΔHf of a silicon vacancy (VSi) is about 3.67 eV. Despite of the high ΔHf, 
the Ar-related defects can still be formed under laser irradiations. A key reason is that 
the ΔHf can be substantially reduced when Si is melted by laser irradiations, see Fig. 
1(c). Also, compared with interstitial Ar defects, substitutional Ar defects should be 
dominate because an interstitial Ar and a VSi will be annihilated into a substitutional Ar 
once they encounter during the annealing process. This annihilation is obviously energy 
favorable. Moreover, the ΔHf of substitutional Ar defects can further be lowered by 
their accumulation [see Fig. 1(d)] because such an accumulation reduces the number of

dangling bonds.

Formation energies of the accumulated substitutional Ar defects in Si. The formation

Figure 2 elucidates atomic and electronic structures after an Ar atom is introduced into 
Si. In order to study Ar induced defect states in Si, a large supercell with 216 atoms is 
employed. Due to Brillouin Zone folding in the supercell, band structures are calculated 
and further reanalyzed by the effective band unfolding method [22]. The unfolded band 
structure in Fig. 2(d) reproduces the correct E-k dispersion for the intrinsic Si despite 
of underestimating the bandgap by the GGA-DFT method. 
 
Naturally, an Ar atom filling in a Si lattice vacancy (VSi) could be an ideal candidate 
for the IR absorption. Because an intrinsic vacancy has the ability of offering defect

states within the bandgap. Fig. 2(a) displays the local tetrahedral motif in intrinsic Si. 
When a Si atom is removed to form a VSi, four dangling bonds are produced, see Fig. 
2(b). Here, the four atoms around the vacancy are noted as atoms 1, 2, 3, 4 (Si1, Si2, Si3, 
Si4), respectively. Li,j is the distance between any two of them. If no any atomic 
relaxation, the vacancy with all the same Li,j = 3.87 Å holds an ideal Td local symmetry. 
However, due to the well-known Jahn-Teller distortion effect, the four atoms are 
relaxed closer to the center of the vacancy with L1,2 (3.03 Å) ≈ L3,4 (3.12 Å) and other 
Li,j = 3.54 Å. The symmetry is thus lowered to a near D2d symmetry (~D2d) shown in 
Fig. 2(b), which is consistent with a previous result [23]. Accordingly, the energy levels 
of defect states can split into two parts: two occupied levels in the lower part within the 
bandgap while two unoccupied levels in the upper part within the bandgap, see Fig. 2(e) 
of the band structure and its schematic drawing [Fig. 2(h)] for Si with a ~D2d vacancy. 
 
After Ar atoms are introduced into Si which is confirmed by our SIMS measurement, 
the local structures of VSi will be changed. For example, as shown in Fig. 2(c), the 
atomic distortion of VSi can be further enhanced to hold a C2v symmetry due to a Ar 
atom substitutionally filled in VSi (ArSi). In this case, the Ar atom is closer to Si3 and 
Si4, which makes Si3 and Si4 move away from each other. Meanwhile, Si1 and Si2 move 
closer to each other. Therefore, L1,2 and L3,4 are changed to 3.46 Å and 5.40 Å, 
respectively. The ~120°bond angles of Si3 and Si4 indicate the bonding type is changed 
to be sp2-hybridization like while the sp3-hybridization like bonding still remains for 
Si1 and Si2. Our calculations found that the filling of Ar into VSi costs about 2.56-eV 
extra energy. Such large an interaction energy and the large structural distortion suggest 
that Ar should have a significant repulsive interaction with surrounding dangling bonds 
of Si atoms, i.e., the steric repulsion effect. The steric-repulsive induced distortion 
(SRD) also leads to a larger bonding hierarchy and changes the defect states of VSi. 
Accordingly, comparing to the case of VSi, defect levels of ArSi are further splitted, see 
Figs. 2(f) and (i): the energies of highest occupied defect orbital (HODO), lowest 
unoccupied defect orbital (LUDO) and LUDO+1 is raised and closer to conduction 
band while the energy of HODO-1 lowers into the valence band.

FIG. 2. Local atomic structures of (a) Si, (b) VSi and (c) ArSi with the steric-repulsive 
distortion (SRD) holding a C2v symmetry . The arrows indicate the directions of atomic 
relaxation referred to their original positions. (d)-(f) correspondingly show the unfolded 
band structures of the three supercell models. The size of the scatters represents the 
atomic weight. The weights of Si1,2,3,4 (green and red scatters) are amplified by a factor 
of 10. The green and red scatters indicate the contributions from Si1,2 and Si3,4, 
respectively. (g)-(i) show corresponding schematic band structures. Ef is set as 0 eV. 
 
In fact, the local atomic configuration of ArSi defect with SRD is not unique. It can also 
have other structures with a C3v or ~Td symmetry, see Figs. S1(e) and (f) in 
Supplemental Material. In both cases, the four dangling Si atoms (Si1,2,3,4)  are repulsed 
by the Ar and thus tend to have a sp2-like bonding characteristic due to the bond angle 
of ~120°. In the two cases, not only the defect levels but also the spin states are splitted, 
see Figs. S2 and S3 in Supplemental Material. Three of the four electrons from dangling 
bonds occupy three spin-up levels while one occupies a spin-down level.

In fact, the three configurations of ArSi with C2v, C3v and ~Td SRDs almost have the 
same formation energy with little differnece of 0.01-0.03 eV (see Table S1 in 
Supplemental Material). The energy barrier of the tansition between C2v and C3v (C3v 
and ~Td) configurations calculated by the NEB method is also as small as 0.015 (0.013) 
eV, indicating readily transitions to each other. Defect levels always preserve inside the 
bandgap after inert Ar doping in VSi, despite of these different Ar configurations with 
close eneriges. Moreover, the SRD effect still stands in the accumulated substitutional 
Ar defects (3Ar3Si and 4Ar4Si) and thus the splitted defect states also exist (see Fig. S4 
in Supplemental Material). In addition, a bond-centered (B-C.) site interstitial Ar defect 
also has two dangling bonds while the tetrahedral/hexagonal-site interstitial Ar defects 
have no dangling bonds, see Figs. S1(a)-(c) in Supplemental Material. As such, the BC. interstitial Ar also has two defect levels inside the bandgap, see Fig. S5 in 
Supplemental Material. All these defect states no doubt will benefit a robust subbandgap IR absorption in Si. 
 
Next, electronic bonding mechanisms of ArSi are analyzed to figure out the mechanism 
of the Ar doping induced change of defect states. Taking the C2v configuration as an 
example, the charge density difference (CDD) analyses [24] in Figs. 3(a)-(c) show no 
transferred or shared electrons between Ar and its surrounding Si due to the chemical 
inertia of Ar. Therefor, the interaction between Ar and the dangling Si atoms should be 
Coulomb repulsion effect which agrees with the SRD of the local structure. In fact, 
although Ar atom does not offer any defect levels but indirectly modulate defect states 
of a Si vacancy via the repulsion. Figures 3(d)-(h) elucidate the spatial distributions of 
defect states. The updated sp2-like configuration of Si3,4 [see the bond angles of 121° in 
Fig. 3(a)] may release a dangling pz orbital from the orginal  sp3 orbital. Obviously, the 
LUDO+1 and the HODO are the unoccupied  and occupied pz-like orbitals of Si3,4, 
respectively, see Figs. 3(e) and (g). Figure 3(f) shows the LUDO corresponding to the 
unoccupied sp3-like orbital of Si1,2. Since Si1 and Si2 has also a certain interaction due 
to a charge accumulation between them shown in Fig. 3(b), their occupied sp3-like state

further moves below the valence band maximum. We indeed find the state by projecting 
the orbital-decomposed partial charge density inside valence band [see Fig. 3(h)]. Such 
a defect state will move back into bandgap in the case of C3v and ~Td SRDs due to the 
absence of such interaction between dangling Si atoms (see Figs. S2 and S3 in 
Supplemental Material).

and (110) slices of the CDD. The unit of the color bar is e/a03. (d) Schematic defect

To directly demonstrate the influence of the Ar-related defect on the IR absorption at λ 
= 1.31/1.55 μm, the aobsorption coefficients are calculated [see Fig. 4(a)]. Here, the 
meta-GGA method using the modified Becke-Johnson (MBJ) exchange potential 
[25,26] is adopted to correct the bandgap underestimated by the traditional PBE 
functional (see Fig. S6 in Supplemental Material for the effect of correction). Obviously,

a substantial enhancement of the sub-bandgap IR absorption is achieved by ArSi in great 
contrast to the case without defect (Si) that displays almost no absoprtion. Moreover, 
the substitutioanl defects also have stronger abosorptions compared with the interstitial 
Ar and VSi, owing to the repulsion induced splitting of defect levels.

In fact, the repulsion effect of Ar on dangling electrons not only changes the atomic 
structure and the position of defect levels but also significantly affects the ionization 
process. When the Ar is filled into the vacancy, the strong repulsive interaction between 
Ar and dangling electrons should make the electrons be ionized easily. Figures 4(b)-(d) 
show the calculated chemical potential dependent ΔHf of neutral and charged states of 
the Ar defects [27,28]. According to the position of transition levels (where the ΔHf of 
neutral and charged states equal), it is surprising that the substitutional Ar defects are 
shallow donors but deep acceptors. In contrast, the B-C. interstitial Ar still has deep 
donor and acceptor levels. The shallow donor effect of ArSi defects can explain the

confusion that the fabricated sample shows a substantially enhanced n-type carrier 
concentration [8]. In other words, the substitutional Ar can act as an electronic impurity 
despite of its inert chemical property.

during the MD simulation. Inset in (e) shows the schematic trajectory of diffusion of a 
pure VSi in the simulation. 
 
It worth noting that VSi has the lowest ΔHf (3.67 eV) among the defects in Si and it 
can also offer a significant sub-bandgap IR absorption. As mentioned above, the 
absorption of ArSi is in fact originated from defect states of dangling bonds around the 
Ar filled vacancy. However, for practical device applications, IR absorption sources 
should be reliable enough. Therefore, two ab initio MD simulations of 60 ps at 500 K,

which is significantly higher than room temperature at which detector devices work, 
are performed to compare the structural stability between ArSi and pure VSi. Figures 5(a) 
and (b) show the projected atomic trajectories with time for the local structures of ArSi 
and the VSi, respectively. During the MD simulations, the instant sites of the vacancy 
are determined by the Wigner-Seitz method as implemented in the OVITO code [18]. 
It is clear that the Ar atom in ArSi is in form of a kind of rattling motion and moves 
much more intensely than normal Si atoms behave in lattices. The result is consistent 
with the negligible energy barriers among different SRD configurations of a ArSi. 
Despite of such intense motions, ArSi stays in a same lattice firmly during the whole 
MD simulation. Note that the multi-substitutional Ar defects (e.g., 4Ar4Si) also stable 
during a 500 K MD simulation (see Fig. S7 in Supplemental Material). In a great 
contrast, the pure VSi shows an easy diffusion among different lattices. Next, the c-NEB 
analyses further evaluate barriers of atomic diffusions in Si. First, the energy barrier of 
a single VSi diffusion can be as low as 0.26 eV, see Fig. 5(d). The probability of its 
diffusion behavior at 500 K could be simply estimated by Arrhenius equation: 𝑃= 𝑣∙
exp (−
𝐸𝑎
𝑘𝐵𝑇), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, Ea is the energy 
barrier of diffusion and v can be regarded as atomic vibration frequency. Using the 
frequency of highest optical phonon of crystalline Si, i.e., ~15 THz [29], the estimated 
characteristic time for one diffusion event is 𝜏=
1
𝑃≈30 ps for the VSi. Figure 5(e) 
shows the mean square displacement (MSD) of VSi during the 500-K MD simulations. 
The pure VSi can move in different lattices as many as 8 times within 60 ps, which is 
close to the estimated characteristic time. That indicates in a practical Si sample the 
pure VSi can readily diffuses among the lattices at the raised temperature and will be 
eliminated when it gets to a grain boundary or a surface by an annealing process. As 
such, the significant sub-bandgap absorption by VSi as shown in Fig. 4(f) cannot readily 
happens. Second, in a great contrast, the energy barrier for an Ar diffusion out of a 
vacancy (i.e., an Ar exchanges its site with an adjacent Si atom) is as high as 1.8 eV, 
see Fig. 5(c). We have performed c-NEB calculations with other two different paths for 
Ar diffusions and the barriers are almost the same (~1.8 eV), see Fig. S8 in

Supplemental Material. The atomic pictures of the ArSi diffusions are presented in Figs. 
S9-S11 in Supplemental Material. According to the Arrhenius equation, the 
characteristic time for the Ar diffusion is at least ~ 70000 s, indicating a robust stability 
of ArSi. Moreover, in another 60-ps MD in Fig. S12 of Supplemental Material, the 
diffusion of ArSi is still absent at a much higher temperature of 900 K, which is usually 
as an annealing temperature for fabrications of black Si detectors. Therefore, ArSi can 
be regarded as a kind of Ar locking vacancy (ALV) defect. 
 
Finally, we discuss benefits of the ArSi or ALV doping for IR absorptions in Si detectors. 
Firstly, the steric repulsion induced band splitting makes the ArSi defect readily 
contribute multi defect states and thus offer effective sub-bandgap IR sources, which is 
impossible for intrinsic Si. Secondly, due to Coulomb repulsion of the fully occupuied 
shell of Ar, local configurations of the ALV can be dynamically adjusted by the Ar atom 
at a raised temperature or even room temperature, see Fig. S13 in Supplemental 
Material, which leads to a broad IR absorption band. Thirdly, Ar acts like an electronic 
impurity with shallow donor defect levels. Then, the N+ layer can be formed which is 
the key to construct the N+-N- junction in the device of IR detector [8]. 
 
Conclusion 
In summary, we detect an unexpected high dose of inert Ar (with 1017-1020 cm-3) by 
SIMS measurements in laser modified Si samples at Ar protective gas even after more 
than 1300 days from when it was fabricated. First-principles calculations and molecular 
dynamics simulations demonstrate a mechanism of Ar locking vacancy (ALV or ArSi) 
happening in Ar doped silicon. While the pure vacancy in silicon can readily diffuse at 
500 K, the ALV defect is dynamically robust at the same condition even no direct 
chemical bonding connection between Ar and its neighboring Si atoms. Despite of the 
chemical inert property of Ar, it can still act as an electronic impurity via strong 
Coulomb repulsion effect which leads to significant splitting of defect levels within 
bandgap, and thus have a strong sub-bandgap IR absorption in Si. It is an impossible 
task for intrinsic Si. Moreover, the repulsion between Ar and dangling electrons leads

to a shallow donor effect, which explains the confusion of n-type doping effect of laser 
irradiation observed in previous experiments. It is reasonable to expect that such an 
inert element induced IR absorption mechanism may also happen in other 
semiconductors. Our work opens up a new door of using inert element doping 
engineering to develop high performance IR Si detector, which is urgently required in 
current Si based integrated optoelectronics.

TABLE S1. Formation energies of the defects in crystalline Si. The unit is eV. VSi is a 
silicon vacancy. Tetrahedral (Tetra.), hexagonal (Hex.) and bond-centered (B-C.) 
represent three different sites of the interstitial Ar defects [see Fig. S1(a)-(c) for the 
atomic pictures]. C2v, C3v and ~Td represent three different configurations of the 
substitutional Ar defects as described in the main text [see Fig. S1(d)-(f) for the 
atomic 
pictures]. 
2Ar2Si, 
3Ar3Si 
and 
4Ar4Si 
represent 
the 
accumulated 
multi-substitutional Ar defects [see Fig. S1(g)-(i) for the atomic pictures]. The 
formation energies of multi-substitutional Ar defects are averaged by the number of 
Ar atoms. Under the jellium approximation, the formation energy of defect w with 
charge q can be calculated by the following equation: 
𝛥𝐻𝑓(𝑞, 𝑤) = 𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡(𝑞, 𝑤) −𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡(ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡) + ∑𝑛𝑖𝜇𝑖
𝑖
+ 𝑞(𝜀𝑉𝐵𝑀+ 𝜀𝐹) 
where 𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡(𝑞, 𝑤) is the total energy of the supercell with defects, 𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡(ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡) is the 
energy without the defect (i.e., bulk Si), 𝑛𝑖 is the number of atoms being exchanged 
during the formation of the defect, 𝜇𝑖 is the atomic chemical potential of an element 
(here we use the 𝜇𝑖 of bulk and isolated atom for Si and Ar, respectively), and 𝜀𝐹 is 
the Fermi energy relative to the valence band maximum, 𝜀𝑉𝐵𝑀.

FIG. S3. The unfolded band structure of the ArSi with the ~Td configuration [see Fig. 
S1(f) for the atomic structure], which is very similar to the ArSi SRD-C3v 
configuration. The states contributed by the defective atoms are highlighted by red 
color. 
 
 
FIG. S4. The unfolded band structures of the (a) 3Ar3Si [see Fig. S1(h) for the atomic

FIG. S5. The unfolded band structure of the (a) Tetra.-site [see Fig. S1(a) for the 
atomic picture] and (b) B-C.-site [see Fig. S1(c) for the atomic picture] interstitial Ar 
defects. The states contributed by the defective atoms are highlighted by red color. 
The defect states exist in the supercell with a B-C. interstitial Ar defect because the Ar 
atom in this case breaks a Si-Si bond. 
 
 
FIG. S6. Comparison of the density of states (DOS) of calculated by traditional PBE 
functional and the meta-GGA method using the modified Becke-Johnson (MBJ)
