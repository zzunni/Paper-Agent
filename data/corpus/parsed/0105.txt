The availability of thin-ﬁlm lithium niobate
on insulator (LNOI) and advances in processing
have
led
to
the
emergence
of
fully
integrated LiNbO3 electro-optic devices[1–4], including low-voltage[5], high-speed modulators[6],
electro-optic frequency combs[7], and microwaveoptical transducers [8, 9].
Yet to date, LiNbO3
photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have mostly
been fabricated using non-standard etching techniques that lack the reproducibility routinely
achieved in silicon photonics.
Widespread future application of thin-ﬁlm LiNbO3 requires a
reliable and scalable solution using standard processing and precise lithographic control.
Here
we
demonstrate
a
heterogeneously
integrated
LiNbO3 photonic platform that overcomes the
abovementioned challenges by employing waferscale bonding of thin-ﬁlm LiNbO3 to planarized
low-loss silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits[10], a mature foundry-grade integrated photonic platform.
The resulting devices combine the substantial Pockels eﬀect of
LiNbO3 with the scalability, high-yield, and complexity of the underlying Si3N4 PICs.
Importantly, the platform maintains the low propagation loss (< 0.1 dB/cm) and eﬃcient ﬁber-to-chip
coupling (<2.5 dB per facet) of the Si3N4 waveguides.
We ﬁnd that ten transitions between a
mode conﬁned in the Si3N4 PIC and the hybrid
LiNbO3 mode produce less than 0.8 dB additional loss, corresponding to a loss per transition not exceeding 0.1 dB. These nearly lossless
adiabatic transitions thus link the low-loss passive Si3N4 photonic structures with electro-optic
components.
We demonstrate high-Q microresonators, optical splitters, electrically tunable photonic dimers, electro-optic frequency combs, and
carrier-envelope phase detection of a femtosecond
laser on the same platform, thus providing a reliable and foundry-ready solution to low-loss and
complex LiNbO3 integrated photonic circuits.
Modern society has an constantly increasing demand
for optical communications bandwidth, with aggregate

data rates doubling every 18 months[11, 12], and optical
technology is coming ever closer to the central processing units[13]. Optical modulators play a crucial role in
this context, providing the means to transfer electronic
signals to optical carriers.
With the rise of commercial integrated photonics [14], a wide variety of modulation platforms have been demonstrated that are compatible with wafer-scale manufacturing, among which
silicon and indium phosphide are the most prominent
[15–18]. In the last decade, alternative systems, including organic hybrids [19, 20], plasmonic devices [21], and
modulators based on two-dimensional materials [22–25]
have also been developed. Among all the materials used,
lithium niobate (LiNbO3) remains the most preferable
because of its excellent physical properties, and commercial availability [26]. Advances in wafer-scale transfer of
LiNbO3 thin-ﬁlms via the SmartCutTM technique, combined with improvements in etching of LiNbO3, have
enabled low-loss integrated electro-optics [27–29]. This
has led to several key demonstrations, including ultrahigh-Q optical microresonators[28], eﬃcient electro-optic
frequency comb generation[7], frequency converters [30],
and non-reciprocal devices [31, 32]. In addition, electrooptic modulation both at CMOS voltage levels and at
high speed (up to 100 GHz) has been achieved [5, 6],
oﬀering routes toward compact integrated LiNbO3 modulators compatible with CMOS microelectronics for applications ranging from classical communication for 5G
cellular networks and datacenter interconnects to quantum interfaces for microwave-optical conversion [33–35],
and topological photonics employing synthetic dimensions [36, 37]. Besides the electro-optic applications, integrated LiNbO3 PICs are also of high interest for nonlinear photonics, for example, for eﬃcient second-harmonic
generation, optical squeezing, and parametric ampliﬁcation [38–40].
Despite the achievements to date, widespread adoption of LiNbO3 integrated photonics is still impeded by
several key issues. Current LNOI-based devices are fabricated using speciﬁc non-conventional ion-beam etching
(IBE) to achieve smooth waveguide surfaces. Insuﬃcient
etch-mask selectivity leads to the formation of shallow
ridge waveguides that require more challenging process
control to achieve the desired geometries. This complicates the establishment of a reliable process design kit
(PDK) for integrated LiNbO3 platforms. Second, edge
coupling between ﬁbers and chips is challenging, as the
ridge waveguide structures demonstrated so far show sigarXiv:2112.02018v2  [physics.optics]  12 Sep 2022

niﬁcant coupling loss, 5 to 10 dB per facet, [30] unless more complicated double-etching techniques are used
[41, 42]. Third, while record resonance quality factors (Q
≈107, linear loss of 0.027 dB/cm) have been reported in
LiNbO3 microresonators[28], this has only been demonstrated for selected optical resonances and has not been
achieved broadly in other recently reported works, where
losses are typically one order of magnitude higher (0.2
- 0.3 dB/cm, see Supplementary Table 1 for comparison). For future applications, uniformly low loss across
a wafer using precise and mature lithographic processes,
along with eﬃcient coupling, are necessary to develop a
foundry-level technology that includes PDKs with, e.g.,
splitters, arrayed-waveguide gratings, optical ﬁlters or
beamforming networks.
As an alternative to conventional bulk LiNbO3 and
ridge-waveguide-based photonic devices, hybrid platforms combining thin-ﬁlm LiNbO3 with waveguides made
of Si, Si3N4, or Ta2O5 have been recently developed[43–
45] (see Fig 1(a)-(c)). With proper geometry optimization, the heterogeneously integrated LNOI devices can
reach electro-optic performance comparable to that of
the all-LNOI platforms[46] (VπL = 2.3 V·cm).
Heterogeneous integration using the organic adhesive benzocyclobutene (BCB) to bond LNOI to silicon and direct
bonding of chiplets to silicon and silicon nitride PICs has
been demonstrated, leading to modulators operating at
CMOS voltages [44, 47]. Even though the low-loss operation of hybrid Si3N4-LiNbO3 waveguides was reported
[48, 49], the previous works did not provide reliable studies of wafer-scale uniformity, dispersion, insertion loss,
or other essential aspects of photonic integrated circuits.
The approaches were aimed at speciﬁc device applications and could not demonstrate all the beneﬁts of heterogeneous integration of LiNbO3 with a well-developed
photonic platform. Moreover, the wafer-level bonding required to achieve scalable PDKs was not shown. Here, we
demonstrate a high-yield, low-loss, integrated LiNbO3Si3N4 photonic platform that solves multiple issues of
LNOI integrated photonics. The approach circumvents
the need for optimized IBE etching of LiNbO3 and opens
up the possibility of creating a wide range of low-loss integrated electro-optic photonic circuits. This is achieved
by wafer-scale heterogeneous integration [48, 50] (i.e. di-

rect wafer bonding [51]) of an LNOI wafer onto a patterned and planarized ultra-low-loss Si3N4 substrate as
depicted in Fig 1(c). Our approach combines the maturity of Si3N4 integrated photonics with the large Pockels
eﬀect of LiNbO3 and enables complex, hybrid PICs that
incorporate passive Si3N4 and electro-optic LiNbO3 and
exhibit ultra-low propagation loss (8.5 dB/m).
Fabrication process. The process ﬂow for our hybrid PICs starts with the fabrication of Si3N4 waveguide
structures using the photonic Damascene process [10, 52].
We use a 100 mm-diameter silicon wafer with 4 µm-thick
wet thermal SiO2, followed by deep-ultraviolet (DUV)
stepper lithography, preform dry etching, preform reﬂow,
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) deposition of Si3N4, chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP),
and SiO2 interlayer deposition and annealing, as detailed
in the Supplementary Information. The Si3N4 photonic
Damascene process is free of crack formation in the highly
tensile LPCVD Si3N4 ﬁlm and provides high fabrication
yield and ultra-low propagation loss (1 dB/m). In addition, double-inverse nanotapers [53] are incorporated for
eﬃcient edge coupling to lensed ﬁbers. Previous devices
fabricated using this process have been the workhorse
for numerous system-level applications of soliton microcombs, ranging from coherent telecommunication [54] to
astrophysical spectrometer calibration [55] to supercontinuum generation [56] and turnkey soliton generation
[57].
One of the key advantages of the photonic Damascene process is the possibility of obtaining an extremely
ﬂat wafer surface suitable for heterogeneous integration.
Speciﬁcally, we perform CMP on the SiO2 interlayer and
bond the fabricated Si3N4 Damascene substrate to a
commercially available LNOI wafer (NanoLN). The most
critical constraints for achieving high bonding yield, the
surface roughness and topography, are measured prior
to bonding.
With CMP, the long-range topography is
reduced to a few nanometers over several hundred microns, as shown in Fig.
1(f).
Moreover, atomic force
microscopy (AFM) measurements over a range of a few
microns reveal a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of
400 pm (Fig. 1(e)). This roughness level is suﬃciently
low for direct wafer bonding.
The donor and the acceptor wafer (the Si3N4 substrate and the LNOI wafer,
respectively) are cleaned, and both are coated by atomic
layer deposition (ALD) with a few nanometers of alumina (Al2O3). The wafers are then bonded and annealed
at 250◦C to enhance the bonding strength. See SI for
more technical information on fabrication. We have successfully bonded several wafers, including whole 100-mm
LNOI wafers, with a bonding yield close to 100%, as
evidenced by photoacoustic spectroscopy.
Subsequent
back-end processing and electrode integration are described in the SI. A scanning electron microscope image
(Fig. 1(g)) of a cross-section of the layer structure reveals clean bonding results. Finite-element-method simulations (see Fig. 1(d)) indicate that, for the waveguide and wafer parameters used here (cf. SI for waveguide geometry), the optical mode conﬁnement factor for
LiNbO3 at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550
nm is Γ =
˜
LiNbO3 |E|2dS/
˜
Ω|E|2dS = 12%, where
Ωdenotes the whole cross-section area. To demonstrate
the electro-optic capabilities of the heterogeneously integrated LiNbO3 photonic circuits, we deposit tungsten
(W) electrodes on top of the LiNbO3 adjacent to the
waveguides with an electrode-electrode gap of 6 µm.
To illustrate the versatility, lithographic precision,
complexity, and yield of the hybrid platform, we design
a reticle with various devices. Figure 2(e) shows the design layout of the Si3N4 photonic circuits for a 100-mm
wafer; it contains nine ﬁelds with 16 chips each – in total, more than 100 chips with dimensions of 5 mm ×
5 mm.
The reticle includes chips with three diﬀerent
types of devices: (1) microresonators with a free spectral
range (FSR) of either 100 GHz or 21 GHz, the former being used for electro-optic comb generation; (2) photonic
molecules consisting of a pair of coupled microresonators
each with a FSR of 50 GHz, as used for microwave-optical
conversion schemes; and (3) waveguides with a length of
several centimeters for supercontinuum generation (wafer
D67b01).
Optical loss characterization. Linear propagation
loss is crucial in determining the performance of integrated electro-optic devices, as it limits the length of
electro-optic modulators and the complexity of the associated photonic circuit. To measure the linear optical
loss, evanescent coupling properties, and group velocity
dispersion (GVD) of the hybrid structures, we perform
broadband frequency-comb-assisted spectroscopy [58] of
multiple microresonators across the entire wafer with
three diﬀerent external-cavity diode lasers covering the
wavelength ranges of 1260–1360 nm, 1355–1505 nm, and
1500–1630 nm. The intrinsic quality factors of individual
100 GHz microring resonators reach up to Q = 3 × 106,
while the 50 GHz photonic dimers (i.e., coupled microrings) and 21 GHz single rings exhibit even higher
quality factors up to Q = 4.5 × 106. The latter corresponds to a linear propagation loss of 8.5 dB/m.
We
observe an absorption peak at approximately 1420 nm
(207 THz), which we associate with an overtone of OHbond vibrations in lithium niobate [59, 60]. As shown in
Fig 2(g), optical losses rise with increasing optical frequency.
We associate this dependency with increased
whispering-gallery (radiation) loss as the mode shifts into
the LiNbO3 thin ﬁlm at higher frequencies and becomes
less conﬁned (see Fig 2(f)). For the same reason, we observe nearly uniform evanescent coupling of optical microresonators over a span of 55 THz. The layout in Fig
2(e) is labeled with the most probable linewidth measured for 21 GHz microresonators in various regions, indicating the degree of variation across the wafer (see Supplementary Information). These results not only demonstrate high yield and wafer-scale fabrication but include
some of the highest quality factors achieved to date with
integrated LiNbO3 devices.
Notably, the Qs reported
here are not isolated values as in prior work on ridge

resonators[28] but are consistently high, i.e., we measure
hundreds of resonances with Q above 4 × 106 (linewidth
below 50 MHz), as shown in Fig. 2(h).
Our hybrid platform also oﬀers the possibility of precise dispersion engineering; due to the interplay between
material dispersion and the optical mode distribution,
the dispersion can be adjusted by varying the Si3N4
waveguide geometry or the LiNbO3 thickness.
In this
work, we designed the structure to work in the nearzero GVD regime advantageous for broadband optical
frequency comb generation. As shown in Fig. 2(d) for
a microresonator with a FSR of 100 GHz, the measured
integrated microresonator dispersion (Dint) only varies
by 15 GHz over an optical bandwidth of 55 THz. Interestingly, there is no constraint preventing the design
of devices that are uniformly coupled over a broad frequency range and, at the same time, have extremely small
dispersion.
Fiber-chip coupling and interface transitions.
Eﬃcient input coupling from an optical ﬁber to the
photonic chip is paramount for numerous applications.

pers lead to ﬁber-chip edge-coupling losses of around
10 dB per facet unless complicated multi-layer etching is
used[41, 61, 62]. This is due to the signiﬁcant mode mismatch between the lensed ﬁber mode (typically circular
with about 2.5 µm diameter) and the asymmetric mode
of partially etched air-cladded ridge waveguide structures. Some recent work on integrated LiNbO3 devices
demonstrated the possibility of using embedded silicon
edge-couplers to overcome this challenge[6]. In our case,
the relative indices of refraction of the materials would
lead to signiﬁcant coupling loss if the LiNbO3 layer remained on top of underlying Si3N4 inverse tapers. Hence,
we remove the LiNbO3 from the coupling regions and rely
on standard Damascene Si3N4 inverse tapers[53]. While
this provides an eﬃcient input coupling, there remains
the challenge of the transition between the regions with
and without LiNbO3. To address this issue, we designed
and implemented adiabatic tapers in the LiNbO3 layer,
as shown in Fig.3(c). The tapers are 100 µm long with
a tip width of 500 nm and a ﬁnal width of 10 µm. Both
ﬁlm removal and etching of the tapers are done in a single fabrication step using argon ion-beam etching with a
photoresist etch mask (see the Supplementary Information for details on taper fabrication). All the functional
photonic components do not depend on the etching of
the chip interface, which is employed only at mode transition regions and, due to the short taper length, does not
require low roughness. We thus keep the LiNbO3 layer
unprocessed for all the photonic components, where both
roughness and precise alignment are critical to achieving
low optical losses.
To measure the eﬃciency of the adiabatic transitions

and remove the ambiguity associated with the ﬁber-chip
coupling loss from the measurement, we designed an experiment in which we introduce multiple breakouts on
straight waveguides, where the optical mode experiences
transitions from Si3N4 waveguides into the hybridized
mode and back as depicted in Fig. 3(b). We fabricated
waveguides with 2, 4, 6, and 10 transitions (input/output
tapers and 0, 1, 2, and 4 breakouts, respectively) to determine the increase in loss due to each transition. Figure 3(d) shows the results of these measurements.
As
a reference, we compare them with straight interfaces
(schematic in Fig.3(e)). As can be seen in Figure 3(f),
each straight transition leads to approximately 1 dB loss,
whereas the tapered input/output behaves in this measurement as a virtually lossless transition. Strikingly, for
the case of the tapered transitions, we observe hardly
any diﬀerence between 2, 4 and 6 interfaces, as shown
in Figure 3(d) and approximately only 0.8 dB additional
loss for ten interfaces. Considering the statistical uncertainty in the measurements, we deduce a transition loss
of <0.1 dB per taper. Calibration of the transmission
measurements is discussed in the Supplementary Information.

mentation of a W-shaped 3-dB splitter/coupler[63] (see
Fig.
3(g)) that uses the hybrid Si3N4-LiNbO3 mode
but is deﬁned solely by underlying Si3N4 inverse tapers.
Splitters are important components for many optical devices, such as electro-optic modulators, optical networks,
and lasers based on reﬂective semiconductor optical ampliﬁers. The elegance of this type of splitter is in its simplicity of design. Due to the presence of the LiNbO3 slab
and the single-mode nature of our hybrid waveguides,
the optical mode is adiabatically transferred from the
input arm to the output arms.
We make the tapered
sections 100 µm long, ensuring a small footprint for integrated components exploiting this design. Transmission
measurements of the device reveal a ﬂat response, with
power asymmetry between the two arms not exceeding
1.7 dB and on-chip insertion loss not exceeding 1 dB in
the 1500-1620 nm wavelength range (Fig.3(h)).
Electro-optic devices. To demonstrate the electrooptic performance achievable with our high-quality factor, hybrid LiNbO3 microresonators, we generate electrooptic frequency combs in the 21 GHz resonators pumped
resonantly in the telecommunications C-band. We apply a high-power microwave signal with a frequency
20.97 GHz across the integrated electrodes such that
microwave-induced sidebands are resonantly enhanced
(Fig 4(a)-(b)).
Even though only 12% of the optical
mode is conﬁned inside the lithium niobate, it is enough
to achieve strong modulation of the optical phase. We
observe around 60 sidebands within a 25 dB span for an
injected RF power of 40 dBm, as depicted in Fig 4(c).
In this experiment, the phase modulation amplitude corresponds to approximately 0.14π (see Supplementary Information). The electro-optic coupling is enhanced due
to the device’s high quality factor and ﬂat dispersion. We
also make use of the previously mentioned homogeneous
coupling of our hybrid devices at optical wavelengths
ranging from 1260 nm to 1630 nm to generate electrooptic comb at ﬁve diﬀerent pump wavelengths (1290 nm,
1345 nm, 1500 nm, 1550 nm, and 1625 nm) on a single device (Fig 4(d)). Moreover, according to the simulations, the geometry can be optimized for maximum
electro-optic eﬃciency with a characteristic Vπ · L product comparable to (2x larger than) the performance of Xcut ridge-waveguide platforms[5]. The reason is that, in
ridge waveguides, most of the electro-optic interaction occurs not in the ridge itself, but in the slab layer, where the
modulating electric ﬁeld is a factor of magnitude stronger
(see Supplementary Information). Therefore, the ridge
waveguides and hybrid waveguides are conceptually similar in terms of electro-optic interactions (i.e., the role
of the slab in ridge waveguides is being taken over by
the bonded LiNbO3 layer in our hybrid structure). Similar studies on optimization of electro-optic performance
of heterogeneously integrated LiNbO3 devices can also
be found elsewhere[46].
As a further example of the
electro-optic capabilities, we fabricate photonic dimers,
which are known building blocks for quantum coherent
transducers based on cavity electro-optics[9, 34, 64–66].
Figure 4(g) shows the mode hybridization in the system
as a function of the applied DC voltage.
We observe
frequency tuning of 30 MHz/V when a DC voltage is
applied to one of the rings. Moreover, the precise and
mature fabrication of the Si3N4 waveguides enables the
creation of high-Q photonic dimers exhibiting broadband
normal mode splitting even at zero-bias (cf Figure 4(f)-
(h)).
The presence of avoided mode crossings for the
symmetric supermode (lower frequency) is common with
the photonic dimer conﬁguration[67]. In one last experiment exploiting the χ(2) nonlinearity of the LiNbO3, we
perform supercontinuum generation in the hybrid waveguides. We observe octave-spanning supercontinuum generation mediated by the χ(3) nonlinearity, together with
simultaneous second-harmonic generation due to the optical ﬁeld in the LiNbO3, allowing direct measurement of
the carrier-envelope oﬀset frequency of the femtosecond
pulse laser used as a pump. The details of this experiment can be found in the Supplementary Information.
Summary.
To conclude, we have demonstrated a
hybrid Si3N4-LiNbO3 platform for photonic integrated
circuits using direct wafer-scale bonding that endows
the mature Si3N4
Damascene technology with the
second-order nonlinearity (χ(2)
/ Pockels eﬀect) of
LiNbO3.
The heterogeneous integration preserves the
precise lithographic control, low propagation loss, and
eﬃcient ﬁber-to-chip coupling of the underlying Si3N4
waveguides for use in a variety of important photonic
building blocks.
We have also presented a design for
the transition from Si3N4 waveguides to hybrid Si3N4LiNbO3 waveguides with a measured insertion loss not
exceeding 0.1 dB per interface. The ability to achieve
low-loss transitions is essential for the realization of complex devices, providing a bridge between passive silicon
nitride photonics and electro-optic devices. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time a heterogeneously
integrated LiNbO3 photonic platform combines all the
beneﬁcial features of Si3N4 PICs at wafer scale.
A
comparison of the simultaneously achieved desirable
features is given in Supplementary Table 1. With further
geometry optimization, the electro-optic performance
can reach levels comparable to that of ridge waveguide
structures while keeping propagation losses independent of the quality of the LiNbO3 etching.
Possible
applications of our platform include photonic switching
networks for neuromorphic or quantum computing,
devices for quantum state transduction from microwave
to optical photons, integrated electro-optic frequency
comb sources, on-chip generation of second-harmonic
and squeezed light, as well as high-speed electro-optic
devices for optical communications or rapidly tunable,
low-noise lasers.
