Abstract 
The light output of deep ultraviolet (UV-C) AlGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is limited 
due to their poor light extraction efficiency (LEE).  To improve the LEE of AlGaN LEDs, 
we developed a fabrication technology to process AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC into thinfilm flip-chip LEDs (TFFC LEDs) with high LEE.  This process transfers the AlGaN LED 
epi onto a new substrate by wafer-to-wafer bonding, and by removing the absorbing SiC 
substrate with a highly selective SF6 plasma etch that stops at the AlN buffer layer.  We 
optimized the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) SF6 etch parameters to develop a substrateremoval process with high reliability and precise epitaxial control, without creating 
micromasking defects or degrading the health of the plasma etching system.  The SiC etch 
rate by SF6 plasma was ~46 µm/hr at a high RF bias (400 W), and ~7 µm/hr at a low RF 
bias (49 W) with very high etch selectivity between SiC and AlN.  The high SF6 etch 
selectivity between SiC and AlN was essential for removing the SiC substrate and exposing 
a pristine, smooth AlN surface.  We demonstrated the epi-transfer process by fabricating 
high light extraction TFFC LEDs from AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC.  To further enhance 
the light extraction, the exposed N-face AlN was anisotropically etched in dilute KOH.  
The LEE of the AlGaN LED improved by ~3X after KOH roughening at room temperature.  
This AlGaN TFFC LED process establishes a viable path to high external quantum 
efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) UV-C LEDs.

1. Introduction  
 
AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) and ultraviolet laser diodes (UV 
LDs) in the range of 265–280 nm are needed to develop novel disinfection and sterilizing 
technologies (water, air, and surfaces) to improve access to clean water [1–4], improve 
public health [5,6], and enable other biotech applications [7–10].  UV LEDs are a viable 
technology for replacing mercury gas discharge lamps in disinfection and biotechnology 
applications [11–18].  Hospitals, for example,  reduced the rates of hospital-acquired drugresistant infections by 25% using ultraviolet disinfection (via mercury lamps (254 nm)), as 
reported by various clinical trials [19,20].  Furthermore, the AlN or AlGaN epi-transfer

and heterogeneous integration technology can be employed to enhance the performance of 
photodiodes (PDs) [21], high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) [22,23], bulk acoustic 
resonators (BARs) [24–26], and high-aspect-ratio SiC microstructures and devices [27–
30]. 
 
Researchers developing AlGaN LEDs have made significant progress in the last 30 
years [11,18,31–44]; however, the technology is limited by light extraction efficiency 
(LEE) [45–54].  The LEE of AlGaN LEDs is less than that of InGaN blue LEDs for five 
main reasons.  First, the absence of a transparent current spreading layer over p-GaN, such 
as indium tin oxide (ITO) for blue LEDs, requires the use of flip-chip (FC) LEDs 
architecture with a highly-reflective p-side down.  Second, the poor conductivity of Mgdoped AlGaN necessitates the use of an optically absorbing p+-GaN layer for hole injection 
into the Mg-doped AlGaN and the formation of an ohmic p-contact; GaN has an absorption 
coefficient of 1.5x105 cm-1 at 275 nm [55].  Third, the reflectivity of ohmic p-contacts, is 
limited to ~70-80% , in the 265-280 nm range.  Fourth, the light from the AlGaN MQW 
emitters at these wavelengths is ~40% transverse magnetic (TM) polarized [47,48,56–58], 
which propagates laterally; finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations estimate 
that the extraction of TM emission is >10X less efficient than transverse electric (TE) 
polarization in typical volumetric FC LEDs [48] (in volumetric FC LEDs light has to travel 
through the transparent growth substrate) [48].  Lastly, the encapsulants used to enhance 
LEE in blue LEDs suffer low transparency, poor stability, and a low refractive index in 
deep ultraviolet LEDs [59–63]. 
 
The most commonly employed substrates for AlGaN UV-C LEDs are sapphire and 
AlN but they yield LEDs with low LEE.  Although sapphire substrates are transparent, 
their thermal conductivity is limited, and they lack efficient ways to extract TM 
polarization because roughening the sidewalls of sapphire LEDs dies is challenging [46].  
AlN substrates grown by physical vapor transport (PVT) are limited by an absorption 
around 264 nm (4.7 eV) with an absorption coefficient of about ~35 cm-1 [64] whereas 
hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown AlN substrates have less absorption (~10 cm1) [65].  Researchers have largely overlooked AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC substrates [66–
74] because SiC absorbs strongly below its optical bandgap (3.2 eV and 3.0 eV for 4H-SiC 
and 6H-SiC, respectively), but this disadvantage can be overcome with a novel thin-film 
flip-chip (TFFC) LED architecture in which the SiC is removed with a highly selective SF6 
chemical plasma etch between SiC and AlN.  
  
Growing AlN on SiC substrates is promising due to their similar crystallographic 
structure, polarity, chemical stability, and low lattice mismatch (0.8%) [75–80].  AlN 
grown on SiC with low threading dislocations has been demonstrated with MOCVD 
[78,81] and plasma-assisted MBE [71,76].  Furthermore, we demonstrate in this paper that 
AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC can be processed into thin-film LEDs with high LEE [82–85]; 
for example, FDTD simulations by Ryu et al. show that TM emission’s LEE in textured 
thin-film LEDs is significantly higher (>6X) than in volumetric AlGaN FC-LEDs [48].  
InGaN thin-film blue LEDs were developed with very high LEE using laser lift-off for 
substrate removal, N-face GaN KOH photoelectrochemical (PEC) roughening, and a pside reflective mirror [86–88].  Several methods for laser lift-off of AlGaN UV-C LEDs

have been developed [89–94]; however, laser-induced melting of the Al in the dislocated 
interface of the AlN buffer layer in AlGaN LEDs causes more cracks than laser lift-off of 
the GaN buffer layer in InGaN LEDs [95] because the Al melts at 660 °C, whereas Ga 
melts at 30 °C [91].  Employing PEC etching to lift-off thin-film LEDs from their growth 
substrates [70,71] is more difficult with AlN than with GaN because N-face AlN etches 
anisotropically in KOH (without above-bandgap light assistance) considerably faster 
(~20x) than N-face GaN does [98].  Thus, KOH roughening can damage the active region 
before the lateral lift-off etch is completed.  
 
In this paper, we demonstrate a process to fabricate high extraction efficiency TFFC 
LEDs grown on SiC.  We characterize SiC and AlN etching using inductively coupled 
plasma (ICP) SF6 plasma.  The SF6 gas flow, process pressure, and sample RF bias power 
were investigated to determine first-order trends between the etch parameters and the etch 
rates of SiC and AlN.  Next, the etch parameters were optimized to develop a highly reliable 
SiC substrate-removal process with no micromasking defects and precise epitaxial control, 
without degrading the plasma etching system health.  A highly selective SF6 etch between 
SiC and AlN (90:1) was achieved which was essential for removing the SiC substrate and 
exposing a smooth AlN surface (roughness ~0.6 nm).  We demonstrate high LEE thin-film 
flip chip (TFFC) AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC.  We compare the power output of TFFC 
AlGaN LEDs before and after KOH roughening of the exposed AlN surface.  The AlGaN 
LED’s LEE improved by ~3X after roughening in KOH [0.25 M] for 70 sec at room 
temperature.  
 
2. SiC substrate thinning characteristics 
 
AlN was grown on quartered 2-inch 6H-SiC substrates (SiCrystal AG) by MOCVD as 
described elsewhere [81].  A one-step lapping process was used to thin the SiC substrates 
after bonding them to a carrier with high thermal conductivity (4.9 W/cm a-plane, 3.9 
W/cm c-plane) with n- and p- bonding pads using Au/Au thermocompression bonding 
[73,74].  The SiC based samples were mounted episide-down on a 2-inch  stainless-steel 
chuck using a wax (that melts at 120 °C), which provides mechanical adhesion during 
lapping.  The lapping process was performed using South Bay Technologies multipurpose 
lapping system (Model 920).  The SiC growth substrates were thinned from 250 µm to 75 
µm by lapping with a 9 µm Dia-Grid Diamond Disc (Allied High Tech Products, Inc.).  
The water-cooled lapping tool had a lapping rate of 29 µm/hr using 9 µm grit diamond 
discs.  A summary of the thinning parameters is shown in Table 1.  The lapping damage 
generated by lapping with a 9 µm grit was approximately 3 x 9 µm = 27 µm, which avoids 
damage to the active region.  The mechanical lapping yields a total thickness variation 
(TTV) of about 15–20 µm across a quartered 2-inch wafer.   
 
3. SF6 etch chemistry characteristics 
 
The SiC substrates  were plasma etched in a Panasonic ICP etching system (E6261) 
using SF6 plasma [67,68,101–103].  ICP etching systems have independent ICP and RF 
bias sources.  The ICP plasma (generated by a current flowing in a planner coil above the 
etch chamber) power controls the ions and radicals densities.  The RF bias power controls

the ions bombardment energy and thus is proportional to sputter (physical) etching.  The 
samples were mounted episide-down on a 6-inch carrier wafer using a vacuum diffusion 
pump fluid, which provides thermal conduction between the sample and the carrier wafer.  
The sample surface temperature depends on the lower electrode temperature and on the 
plasma ions’ energies and densities.  The lower electrode of the ICP system was backside 
cooled by pressurized He, and the carrier wafer temperature was kept at 11 °C during all 
etches.  The 6-inch carrier wafer was a 1.5 mm thick fused silica wafer with a 100 nm Al 
backside coating to hold the fused silica carrier wafer to the electrostatic chuck.  The 
chamber and carrier wafer were cleaned in O2 plasma and then seasoned with a 2 min SF6 
etch at 1000 W ICP power and low RF bias (49 W).  We found that chamber and carrier 
wafer seasoning suppressed the formation of SiC pillars.  The SiC etch rates were 
determined by profilometry (Dektak) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  
 
Etching SiC with SF6 plasma produces the volatile products SiF4, SiF2, CF2 and CF4 
[104]; the absence of etch-induced polymer generation renders the long etching (for several 
hours, if needed) consistent and reliable.  Thus, long SF6 etching does not need to be 
interrupted to clean the etch chamber because the etch chemistry does not cause polymer 
accumulation.  However, the carrier wafer’s temperature in the ICP etch chamber should 
be controlled during long etches because elevated temperatures can increase the SiC etch 
rate.  
 
We developed a two step SF6 ICP etch process to remove SiC: (1) high SiC etch 
rate process; (2) high selectivity SiC:AlN etch process.  The two-step etch parameters are 
summarized in Table 2.   
 
To achieve the highest etch rates of bulk SiC, we observed SiC etch rate as a 
function of SF6 flow and process pressure.  Figure 1(a) shows that the SiC etch rate 
increased as SF6 flow increased, with improved etch uniformity.  Figure 1(b) shows that 
the etch rate was sensitive to the process pressure.  Increasing the process pressure, 
increases the ions’ densities but decreases the ions’ energies, by decreasing its mean free 
path.  The SiC etch rate data in figure 2(b) shows that a chamber pressure of 1.33 Pa 
resulted in the highest SiC etch rate at the following process parameters: 1000 W ICP 
power, 400 W RF bias power, and 50 sccm SF6 flow. 
 
To achieve high etch selectivity, we utilized the fact that SiC etches chemically in 
SF6, whereas AlN does not etch chemically in SF6 and is only etched at a low rate by SF6 
sputter etching (at low RF bias).  Figure 2(a) shows that the SiC etch rate increased as the 
RF bias power increased.  At high RF bias power, SF6 sputter etch dominates whereas at 
low RF bias (below 60 W), SF6 chemical etch dominates and the sputter etch rate for SiC 
and AlN is very low.  The etch rate at 400 W was about ~40 µm/hr when measured over 
40 min and 46 µm/hr when measured over 2 hr.  The SiC substrate was etched first at ~46 
µm/hr over 1.2 hr to remove about 60 µm of SiC; the temperature of the He-cooled carrier 
wafer increased slightly from 11 °C  to 15 °C.  Achieving higher SiC etch rate is possible 
in plasma etch systems that have higher ICP power and RF bias power.

Figure 2(b) shows that the SiC:AlN etch selectivity was very sensitive to RF bias, 
especially below 60 W. .  At high RF bias, the etch selectivity was low (10:1 at 400 W) 
because at this regime, sputter etching has low selectivity between SiC and AlN.  On the 
other hand, the SiC:AlN etch selectivity increased significantly as the RF bias decreased 
below 60 W, where the SF6 chemically etches SiC but does not etch AlN due to the 
formation of the low-volatility species AlF3, which was demonstrated previously in studies 
of selective reactive ion etching of GaAs on AlGaAs and GaP on AlGaP in fluorine 
containing plasma [105–108].  However, the strong dependence of the SiC:AlN etch 
selectivity on the RF bias power decreased when the RF bias power was less than 47 W, 
as the SiC etch rate decreased more than the AlN etch rate did.  
 
SiC:AlN etch selectivity is essential for removing the SiC substrate without 
damaging the active layer by stopping at the AlN buffer layer with precise epitaxial control.  
The etch selectivity was dependent on the substrate temperature (maintained at 11 °C), 
process pressure, and the RF bias power, especially in the 47–49 W region.  For a thinned, 
quartered 2-inch SiC substrate with ~15–20 µm in TTV, a SiC:AlN etch selectivity of 90:1 
at 49 W RF bias and 1.33 Pa was sufficient to reliably and selectively etch SiC and expose 
a pristine surface of N-face AlN.  At a lower process pressure of 0.8 Pa, the SiC:AlN etch 
selectivity increased to 150:1.  This indicates that the selectivity can be increased further 
by optimizing the process pressure.  Senesky et al. [27] reported an SF6 etch selectivity (at 
a low RF bias) of 16:1 (SiC:AlN) using AlN deposited with reactive sputtering; the higher 
bulk SiC etch selectivities obtained with MOCVD-grown AlN (at a low RF bias) indicate 
that AlN grown by MOCVD could replace Ni as a hard mask in fabricating high-aspectratio SiC microstructures and devices [28,29]. 
 
We optimized the SF6 ICP etch to ensure that it removed the thick SiC substrate 
without producing micromasking defects on the thin-film LEDs surface and without 
degrading the plasma etching system health.  First, we avoided the use of commonly used 
metal carriers inside the etch chamber (refer to Table 3).  In ICP plasma etch systems, SF6 
etching is typically performed using a 6-inch Ni or Al carrier wafer because: both have low 
etch rates in SF6 [101,109], as shown in Table 3.  However, the use of metal carrier wafers 
increases micro-masking defects (which produces 40+ µm SiC pillars, as shown in figure 
3(a)) that will not etch completely, even with the selective etch.  Furthermore, sputtered 
metal from metal carriers can affect subsequent etches or cause electrical shorting [27], and 
require manual cleaning of the etch chamber after every etch.  The use of fused silica (SiO2) 
or sapphire carrier wafers minimized the micro-masking defects (SiC pillars) on the etched 
surface and did not affect the ICP etch chamber walls.  The suppression of SiC pillars is 
shown in SEM images in figure 3(b).  Selective etching of a SiC surface with suppressed 
micromasking defects exposed a smooth AlN surface (refer to figure 4(e) for an AFM scan 
of the exposed AlN surface with RMS roughness < 1 nm) that was free of SiC pillars, as 
shown in the optical and SEM micrographs of the TFFC LEDs in figure 5.  Some literature 
indicates that the etch pressure requires optimization to remove SiC pillars; however, we 
found that pillar formation can be suppressed with appropriate selection of the carrier wafer, 
combined with the seasoning of both the carrier wafer and the etch chamber.

4. TFFC UV-C LED (278 nm) demonstration  
 
The thin-film transfer technology was demonstrated on a high LEE TFFC UV-C 
LED, as shown in figures 4-6. 
 
Figure 4 shows the process flow to fabricate TFFC LEDs from LED grown on SiC.  
The AlGaN LED structure was first grown on a quartered 2-inch 6H-SiC substrate 
(SiCrystal AG) by MOCVD as reported elsewhere [85].  The LED structure is shown in 
figure 6(a) and consisted of AlN (3.2 μm), Al0.8Ga0.2N (180 nm), n-Al0.6Ga0.4N (1.1 μm), 
278 nm MQWs 4x(Al0.39Ga0.61N/ Al0.6Ga0.4N), p-Al0.53Ga0.47N (50 nm), and p-GaN (5 nm).  
The samples were cleaved into 1.1 x 1.1 cm2 samples and were processed into LEDs.  The 
n-contact was V/Al/V/Au (20/80/20/200 nm); the p-contact was unannealed Ni/Al/Ni/Au 
(1/150/100/1000 nm) (refer to [85] for details).  After a 3 min solvent clean and 30 sec O2 
plasma clean (100 W), the LEDs were bonded to a thermally conductive substrate (semiinsulating 4H-SiC, Cree, Inc.) with n- and p- bonding pads (20/1500 nm Ti/Au were 
deposited by e-beam).  The samples were bonded using low-temperature Au/Au 
thermocompression bonding.  A Finetech flip-chip bonder (FINEPLACER lambda) was 
employed for aligned wafer-to-wafer bonding.  The bond was performed at 30 N/cm2 for 
5 min at 275 °C in air.  Then, the samples were bonded further in custom-designed graphite 
fixtures that applied ~300 N/cm2 pressure while the sample was annealed at 200 °C for 2 
hr in air (the pressure was maintained during a 5 min cooldown); refer to Table 4 for a 
summary of the low-temperature Au/Au thermocompression bonding parameters. The 6HSiC growth substrate was lapped mechanically to 75 µm and removed by a two-step SF6 
plasma etch, as previously described.  Figure 5(a) shows plain-view optical micrograph 
images of processed UV LEDs with partially exposed AlN during an etch interrupt.  The 
exposed TFFC LEDs had no visible cracks or chipping.  The complete removal of SiC and 
exposure of pristine AlN surface was visible to the eye — a colorful interference pattern 
was observed as the light incident, and reflected from different surfaces in the TFFC LED 
interferes [110].  Also, the wettability of the surface changed as the N-face AlN was 
exposed.  Namely, the surface of the etched carbon-face SiC was hydrophilic, and the 
surface of the exposed AlN was hydrophobic, as shown in figure 5(a).  The TFFC LED 
contacts design is shown in figure 5(b) which shows a 5-finger topology for p-contact, 
surrounded by n-contact, with p-contact area of 0.093 mm2.  The 5-finger p-contact 
topology was adopted to avoid current crowding in the n-AlGaN layer [111], which had a 
relatively high resistivity (~60 mΩ-cm2). 
 
After complete removal of the SiC growth substrate, the suspended AlN/AlGaN/nAlGaN thin-film in-between the TFFC LEDs, which is above the n- and p-pads (as shown 
in figure 5(b)), can be removed via a patterned hard mask (SiO2) and KOH, or by etching 
a wider and deeper mesa around the LEDs mesa (into 80% of the AlN thickness) — before 
FC bonding.  However, we relied on the residual tensile stress in the AlN/AlGaN/n-AlGaN 
film, which caused it to slightly concave upward [98].  Thus, after the TFFC LEDs were 
singulated, the n- and p- pads becomes accessible to wire bonding, as shown in figure 5(c).  
The TFFC LEDs were singulated by mechanical sawing using an ADT 7100 Dicing Saw.  
The TFFC LEDs were covered by photoresist for protection from the cooling/cleaning 
water jets that are needed during mechanical sawing.  Subsequently, the TFFC LEDs were

mounted on TO headers using a Ni-Au epoxy from Dexerials Corp., and the light output 
of the LEDs was measured in a 75 mm integrating sphere (Digital Instruments, Inc.).  
 
Figure 6(b) compares the dependence a TFFC LED’s light output power (L) on the 
injected DC current (I) before and after optimized KOH roughening of the exposed AlN 
surface [85].  The slope of the power versus current increased by ~3X after KOH 
roughening of the exposed AlN layer in dilute KOH (0.25 M) for 70 sec (refer to the bird’seye-view SEM image of the resulting hexagonal pyramids in figure 6(c)).  The LEE 
enhancement after KOH roughening was limited to ~3X  (as estimated from the 
enhancement in the L-I slope) due to the limited p-contact reflectivity and the use of a 5 
nm p+-GaN layer (a strongly absorbing layer) to inject holes into the LED active region.  
Further LEE enhancement is possible without using p-GaN and by using a more reflective 
p-contacts.  For example, the photoluminescence (PL) of MQW wells in an n-i-n structure 
(n-Al0.6Ga0.4N/286-nm-MQWs/n-Al0.6Ga0.4N/Al0.6GaN/AlN) could be enhanced by ~3.9X 
[112] after KOH roughening by using a highly reflective p-contact (a Pt/Al/Ni/Au p-contact 
with a Pt thickness of 0.26 nm and reflectivity of 90% at 286 nm was used to produce a 
~3.9X intensity enhancement in PL after KOH roughening).  
 
The LEE of TM emissions in KOH-roughened TFFC LEDs are expected to be 
higher than in bulk FC LEDs.  For example, Lee et al. studies on LEE in AlGaN UV LEDs 
[113] showed that LEE from a PSS sapphire AlGaN LED die was limited by sidewall 
roughness, more so than in InGaN-based bulk FC LEDs, and that LEE from sidewalls is 
significant in thick (e.g., 300 m thick sapphire) bulk FC AlGaN LED but becomes 
negligible in relatively thin bulk FC AlGaN LEDs (e.g., 90 m thick sapphire).  However, 
in TFFC LEDs, the contribution of sidewall emissions is negligible because the thin-film 
LED widths are much larger than its thickness, which is only 2–3 µm, and both TE and 
TM light emission couple into the roughened AlN surface; for example, FDTD simulations 
by Ryu et al. showed that the LEE of TM emission in roughened AlGaN thin-film LEDs is 
significantly higher (>6X) than in bulk AlGaN FC-LEDs [48].  The TE/TM emissions ratio 
depends on the MQWs strain and the Al composition in the wells and barriers [114–116].  
We speculate that the strain state of the MQWs grown on SiC will be similar to MQWs 
grown on sapphire because (1) the AlN buffer layer is normally relaxed in both sapphire 
and SiC substrates, and therefore the AlGaN MQWs are similarly compressively strained 
by the AlN lattice; and (2) the piezoelectric component due to thermal coefficient of 
expansion (TCE) mismatch (compressive in sapphire, and slightly tensile in SiC) between 
the AlN and AlGaN layers is negated because it affects them similarly.   
 
Estimating the LEE in unroughened thin-film LEDs could be challenging.  For 
example, thin-film blue LEDs with KOH-roughened GaN buffer layers, ray tracing 
simulations estimate 13 % LEE for each single-pass extraction (6 bounces for full 
extraction) [117], whereas wave optics simulations estimate 31% LEE for each single-pass 
extraction (3 bounces for full extraction) [118]. We will discuss our estimates for the LEE 
of TFFC LEDs in a future publication. 
 
After the optimized KOH roughening, the LED CW power was 7.8 mW at 95 mA, emitting 
at 278.5 nm, which yielded an EQE of 2%.  Stable encapsulation [61] can further enhance

the LEE from TFFC LEDs; however, most resins absorb strongly below 330 nm and 
decompose over time, which renders them commercially unviable.  A higher LEE for 
AlGaN TFFC LEDs is also achievable if the p-GaN layer is replaced with a transparent 
hole injector [119–121] or if the reflectivity of the p- and n-metal contacts is increased 
[48,117,122,123].  The IV characteristics do not change with KOH etching as discussed in 
details elsewhere [98] (refer to Figure 6c); however, in the device discussed here the 
voltage increased by ~ 1V after 50 sec KOH etching (refer to Figure 6d) which was 
probably due to a crack in the TFFC LED; however, further KOH etching did not affect 
the IV.  
 
5. Conclusions 
 
We developed a highly selective SF6 plasma etch of SiC over AlN and a viable 
manufacturing method for epitaxial transfer from SiC to another substrate via wafer 
bonding and SiC substrate-removal by SF6 etching.  Then, we demonstrated it on UV-C 
LEDs that were grown on SiC to fabricate high LEE TFFC LEDs.  The SiC substrate was 
bonded via Au-Au thermocompression bonding to another n- and p-patterned thermally 
conductive substrate.  The growth substrate was removed by a two-step ICP etching 
without micromasking defects on the etched surface.  The first step was a high SiC etch 
rate (~46 μm/hr) at a high RF bias power (400 W).  The second step was a selective SiC 
etch rate (~7 μm/hr) at a low RF bias power ( 49 W), with an etch selectivity of SiC:AlN 
~90:1 at a process pressure of 1.33 Pa; higher SiC:AlN etch selectivity of ~150:1 was also 
achieved at a lower process pressure.  The highly selective SF6 etch at low bias was 
essential for removing all SiC by reliably stopping at the LEDs’ AlN buffer layer, which 
acts as an etch stop layer.  We demonstrated a TFFC manufacturing method for UV-C 
LEDs that were grown on SiC.  The LEE was significantly enhanced via KOH roughening 
of the exposed N-face AlN.  KOH roughening enhanced the LEE by ~3X for UV LEDs 
without encapsulation and despite the use of 5 nm p-GaN as a p-contact layer.

List of Figures 
 
 
(a) Bulk SiC etch rate (µm/hr) vs SF6 flow rate (sccm).  
Higher flow rate increases the etch rate and improves the 
lateral etch uniformity. 
(b) Bulk SiC etch rate (µm/hr) vs pressure (Pa).  The etch rate 
peaks at 1.33 Pa when the product of the ions’ energies and 
the ion densities is maximum. 
Figure 1. The SF6 flow and process pressure, were examined to determine the trends between the etch parameters to optimize for 
a high SiC etch rate.  The process parameters were fixed at 1000 W ICP, 400 RF bias, and SF6 50 sccm flow.  The etch rates were 
measured for bulk SiC over a period of ~40 min – on a fused silica carrier wafer.  
 
 
 
(a) Bulk SiC etch rate (µm/hr) vs RF bias (W).   
(b) SiC:AlN etch selectivity as function of RF bias power 
(W).   
Figure 2. In figure 2(a), at high RF bias, the SiC etch rate was dominated by sputter etching, however, at low RF bias sputter etch 
rate is minimal, and SiC is primarily chemically etched.  Figure 2(b) shows that SiC:AlN etch selectivity has a strong dependence 
on RF bias below 60 W.  The SiC:AlN etch selectivity at 49 W RT bias was 90:1 during a 2 hr etch, however, the selectivity 
decreased below 47 W.  A higher SiC:AlN etch selectivity 150:1 (shown in red) was measured at a lower process pressure (0.8 Pa).

Figure 3. SiC pillars can be completely removed from the surface if appropriate process controls are applied.  The image on 
the left (a) shows SiC pillars (40+ µm mircomasking defects) that can form during etching and that will not be completely 
etched even when the highly selective etch is subsequently applied.  The SiC pillars formation was suppressed as shown on the 
right (b) by an optimized etch and process controls: 1) Metal carrier wafers were avoided (fused silica carrier was employed).  
2) The carrier wafer and etch chamber were seasoned with SF6 plasma prior to etching.
