The entire graphene field-effect-transistor (FET) devices first fabricated on SiO2/Si 
are peeled from the surface and placed on a different wafer. Both longitudinal and 
transverse resistivity measurements of the devices before and after the transfer are 
measured to calculate the mobility for a direct comparison. After transferred to different 
SiO2/Si wafers, the mobility generally is comparable and the defect density does not show 
any significant increase, which indicates the degradation due to the transfer process itself 
is minimal. The same method can be applied to transfer graphene devices to any arbitrary 
substrates (e.g. SrTiO3 or STO). The transfer method developed here not only eliminates 
the need to locate single-layer graphene on non-SiO2/Si substrates for patterning, but also 
provides a convenient way to study the effects of various substrates on graphene electronic 
properties.

Mechanical exfoliation has been the very first method for attaining single layer 
graphene [1]. Doped Si wafers with a 300 nm thick layer of thermally grown SiO2 has been 
used as the standard substrate because of the ease of locating via optical microscopy [2]. 
Due to a light interference effect on this specific thickness of SiO2, single-layer graphene is 
distinguishable from bilayer and multilayer graphene via a color contrast [3, 4]. This makes 
establishing the locations of graphene flakes for patterning very efficient with a much 
higher throughput than locating via atomic force microscopy, scanning electron 
microscopy, or Raman mapping. Much work has been done to research the electronic [1, 5, 
6], mechanical [7, 8], and thermal [9, 10] properties and scattering mechanisms [11-14] in 
graphene on SiO2. There are few other substrates that have been used to exfoliate and 
pattern graphene devices [15-17], however comparisons of electronic properties can only 
be made with similar devices on SiO2. Graphene can also be grown via chemical vapor 
deposition [18] and transferred to any arbitrary substrate [19], but again, the 
measurements can only be compared to the well established properties of similar devices 
on SiO2. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a technique for measuring the same graphene 
flake on two different substrates for a direct comparison. In this letter, we report the 
transfer of entire, prefabricated graphene devices from the surface of SiO2/Si to the surface 
of a separate SiO2/Si or SrTiO3 wafer. Electrical measurements are made before and after 
transfer to study the effect on the graphene flake and record any degrading effects. This 
approach is practical for investigating the properties of graphene on any arbitrary 
substrate without the need for locating, which proves quite difficult, or patterning with 
electron beam lithography which can be complicated when using thick dielectrics due to an 
extreme surface charging effect.

Single-layer graphene flakes were exfoliated from Kish graphite onto the surface of 
doped Si wafers with a 300 nm thick layer of thermally grown SiO2. The locations and 
thicknesses of the flakes were determined using optical microscopy and Raman 
spectroscopy. Devices with Hall bar geometry were patterned with standard electron beam 
lithography techniques and metal deposition. Electrical measurements were recorded 
using standard AC lock-in techniques with a constant, perpendicular magnetic field of 
±1500 Gauss and a back-gate applied to the doped Si. The 4-probe longitudinal voltage is 
measured along with the transverse voltage with the ±1500 Gauss field for an accurate 
calculation of the carrier mobility. The transferring of the graphene devices was 
accomplished using similar methods previously reported for the transfer of exfoliated 
graphene flakes [20]. Figure 1 summarizes the steps of the transfer process. After 
measuring on the initial substrate, two layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are 
spin-coated and hard baked for 10 min at 170 °C after each coating. The wafer is placed in a 
beaker of 1 molar aqueous solution of NaOH for partial etching of the SiO2. The SiO2 is 
etched enough for the release of the PMMA/graphene device layer. The wafer is then 
placed in room temperature deionized water and physical peeling with tweezers can 
carefully detach the PMMA/graphene device membrane from the surface. Once it is 
brought to the surface, the membrane floats due to the surface tension and hydrophobic 
nature of PMMA. The target substrate can be brought up from underneath to slowly pull 
the membrane from the water. Placing the target substrate with the PMMA/graphene 
device layer onto a hot plate for 10 min at 50 °C helps to bake out the interfacial water 
layer and remove most of the extraneous wrinkles. A 30 min acetone bath at 65 °C followed 
by a room temperature isopropyl alcohol bath for 10 min will remove the PMMA layer. No

squirt bottles or ultrasonic cleaners can be used to remove the PMMA as it may rinse away 
the metal and render the device immeasurable. The device can now be electrically 
measured again after the transfer.  
The entire device with metal electrodes is transferred to the target substrate as is 
every graphene and bulk graphite flake that was adhered to the surface of the initial SiO2/Si 
wafer. By transferring to another SiO2/Si wafer, the graphene FET device can still be 
visualized with optical microscopy. It is not expected that the graphene has incurred major 
folds or wrinkles induced by the transfer based on AFM studies [20], although it is possible 
that the metal electrodes can migrate from the surface of the graphene during transfer. Fig. 
2 shows the same graphene device before and after transfer. The low magnification optical 
images show the device at the edge of the initial wafer and placed away from the edge on 
the target wafer. The high magnification optical images show the clearly visible graphene 
flake with all electrodes still attached. This transfer method allows a direct comparison of 
the electrical transport properties of the same graphene and electrodes but on different 
SiO2 substrates. The current-voltage characteristics remain linear after transfer, indicating 
little change to the ohmic contacts. Fig. 4(a) shows the conductivity as a function of the gate 
voltage measured before and after transfer. The Dirac point of the transferred device is +9 
V, shifted from +30 V in the pre-transfer device. Such a variation in the position of the Dirac 
point is typically seen in non-transfer devices fabricated on SiO2. After aligning the Dirac 
point, the conductivity can be compared with the relative gate voltage. In these particular 
devices, the effective carrier mobility calculated from the slope is comparable (8,000 vs. 
6,800 cm2/Vs) on the hole side, but is higher on the electron side after transfer (2,800 vs. 
5,300 cm2/Vs). Since we do not always see the same trend in mobility change in a number

of transferred devices, we believe the device-to-device variations in mobility change reflect 
the variations in the local environment on the substrate such as the charged impurity 
distribution as well as other types of defects. In other words, the transfer process itself, e.g. 
etching, rinsing, and drying, does not always degrade the sample quality; therefore, the 
quality of the target substrate is critical. 
Quantitative analysis of the σ vs. Vg curve (Fig. 4a) can be used to calculate the 
impurity density of the graphene before and after transfer to separate SiO2 substrates. 
Using the charged impurity model of ref. 13, ni on the electron side prior to transfer is 1.8 x 
1012 compared to 9.2 x 1011 cm-2 after the transfer. The change in the charged impurity 
density is minimal and actually decreases. The charged impurity density on the hole side 
increases by only 16% after transfer. These charge density variations are commonly seen 
in our non-transfer graphene devices on SiO2 substrates, which reflects the variations in 
charge environment expected with amorphous SiO2 substrates. Another defect analysis can 
be done with Raman data (inset of Fig. 4a). The ratio of the intensities of the D peak and the 
G peak has been used to estimate the defect density of the graphene flake [21]. Because it is 
the same flake, we can focus the 532 nm Raman laser (Horiba LabRam) at the 
approximately same position on the graphene. The calculation of the defect density (away 
from the edge of the flake) again is comparable before and after. Defect density nD before 
transferring is 2.6 x 1010 cm-2 and increases slighly to 7.6 x 1010 after transferring. 
The same method can be used to transfer graphene devices from SiO2 to other types 
of substrates. For example, STO is an interesting material since it has a high dielectric 
constant which is desired for studying the effect of screening on electron transport

properties in graphene. However, locating graphene flakes for lithography proves very 
difficult due to poor contrast under an optical microscope [16]. Fig. 3 shows a comparison 
of optical images of the same graphene device before and after transfer to a 200 m thick 
STO substrate. On STO, the graphene sheet itself is hardly visible, but can be located easily 
from the electrodes and probed by its electrical resistance.  From the carrier density 
measured by the Hall coefficient, we can plot the conductivity σxx as a function of the carrier 
density n (Fig. 4(b)). The σxx vs. n data shows that the overall carrier mobility is not much 
different from that in graphene/SiO2. However, the screening effect can be found in the 
carrier density dependence of the conductivity. When it is on SiO2, its conductivity is linear 
in carrier density over the entire density range except in the vicinity of the Dirac point 
where the conductivity is affected by the residual charge fluctuations, implying a densityindependent mobility (~ 3,000 cm2/Vs) as in typical graphene on SiO2. After transferred to 
STO, the conductivity is no longer linear in carrier density, indicating the effect of screening 
by STO [22]. In fact, the calculated mobility shows an appreciable enhancement as the 
density is decreased from both sides except for the region very close to the Dirac point.   
In summary, we have developed a transfer method and transferred entire graphene 
devices to two types of substrates, i.e. SiO2 and STO. The sample quality is not 
compromised by the transfer process. The intrinsic graphene transport properties of the 
transferred devices can be directly compared with the pre-transfer devices.  This method is 
applicable for transferring pre-fabricated graphene devices to any substrates, and is 
possible for a simultaneous transfer of a large number of devices on a wafer. Graphene can 
be used as a probe to measure unusual surface properties such as carrier density hysteresis
