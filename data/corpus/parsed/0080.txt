Abstract 
Rutile GeO2 has been predicted to be an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor suitable for future 
power electronics devices while quartz-like GeO2 shows piezoelectric properties. To explore 
these crystalline phases for application and fundamental materials investigations, molecular 
beam epitaxy (MBE) is a well-suited thin film growth technique. In this study, we investigate the 
reaction kinetics of GeO2 during plasma-assisted MBE using elemental Ge and plasma-activated 
oxygen fluxes. The growth rate as a function of oxygen flux is measured in-situ by laser 
reflectometry at different growth temperatures. A flux of the suboxide GeO desorbing off the 
growth surface is identified and quantified in-situ by the line-of-sight quadrupole mass 
spectrometry. Our measurements reveal that the suboxide formation and desorption limits the 
growth rate under metal-rich or high temperature growth conditions, and leads to etching of the 
grown GeO2 layer under Ge flux in the absence of oxygen. The quantitative results fit the subcompound mediated reaction model, indicating the intermediate formation of the suboxide at 
the growth front. This model is further utilized to delineate the GeO2-growth window in terms of 
oxygen-flux and substrate temperature. Our study can serve as a guidance for the thin film 
synthesis of GeO2 and defect-free mesa etching in future GeO2-device processing.

Introduction 
In contrast to wide-bandgap semiconductors, such as SiC or GaN, ultra-wide-bandgap (UWBG) 
semiconductors with a bandgap larger than 3.4 eV show great advantages for power electronics 
as their bandgap allows for a larger breakdown field strength that enables much higher power 
density and thus make practical contributions for energy saving1–4. Such merits offer UWBG 
materials a competitive edge over traditional narrow band gap semiconductors. So far, β-Ga2O3, 
diamond, and AlN/AlGaN are the mainstream UWBGs in the fundamental research of high-power 
devices and a series of impressive progress has been achieved5–10. However, β-Ga2O3 encounters 
insurmountable bottlenecks such as poor thermal conductivity and doping asymmetry which 
limit its further breakthrough, while diamond and AlN/AlGaN are hampered by the high AlN and 
diamond substrate price and the difficulties in homogeneous epitaxy8,11. Hence, alternative 
UWBG materials are indispensable to meet  the demand of next generation power devices.  
Rutile GeO2 (r-GeO2) is emerging as promising UWBG oxide material as it possesses a bandgap of 
≈4.7 eV12 and exhibits superior thermal conductivity13 as well as higher predicted carrier mobility 
compared to β-Ga2O3.14 More encouragingly, GeO2 has also been predicted to exhibit a bipolar 
doping behavior, a property that is very rare in most oxide semiconductor materials15. The ability 
to dope r-GeO2 both n- and p-type can thus promote desirable oxide homojunction applications. 
These intrinsic prominent features of r-GeO2 highlight its tremendous prospects in efficient high 
voltage high power electronic applications.14 Besides the rutile phase, GeO2 can also form 
competing amorphous glass16 and piezoelectric quartz-like phases,17 necessitating a stabilization 
of the desired phase by epitaxy. 
To date, several efforts towards growth of single crystalline r-GeO2 using pulsed laser deposition, 
mist-chemical vapor deposition (mist-CVD) and MBE have been reported and recently GeO2 has 
also achieved the transition from the amorphous phase to the polycrystalline one by postannealing 18–23. Among these techniques, MBE is well suited for development of r-GeO2 following 
its success in pioneering the development of Ga2O3 due to the possibility of controlled epitaxial 
growth and doping using the most simple chemistry towards high quality films.10 A 
comprehensive understanding of the reactions during MBE of GeO2 and the rational 
establishment of a growth window are essential for the controlled synthesis of high-quality thin 
films. Specific research on this growth kinetics is lacking at present. Solely, the seminal work by 
Chae et al. 24 demonstrated the MBE growth of r-GeO2 using a source of the suboxide GeO in 
ozone-MBE. They related the observed absence of growth at high growth temperature or low 
ozone partial pressure to a full desorption of the supplied GeO.  
In metal-oxide MBE, MexOy is usually grown by the oxidation of an evaporated metal (Me) or 
suboxide flux by a flux of molecular oxygen, plasma-activated oxygen, or ozone on a heated 
substrate in vacuum. This process has been well studied in several oxide materials. The growth 
kinetics during this process mediated by the suboxide phase as intermediate reaction product 
has been studied in depth for Ga2O3, In2O3, and SnO2 grown from the metal source 25–30 and for 
Ga2O3 grown from the suboxide source.31  

===== Page 3 =====

In this letter, we extend this understanding to explore the growth process of GeO2 without 
focusing on the formed phase. We present a detailed, systematic study investigating the 
formation of oxide and volatile suboxide during MBE growth of GeO2 by monitoring in-situ the 
growth rate (Γ) or etch rate and desorbing species from the growth surface. We observed, that 
the suboxide formation and its desorption reduced the growth rate under oxygen-deficient or 
high temperature growth conditions, and resulted in etching of the grown GeO2 layer by a pure 
Ge-flux. Based on the two-step oxidization mechanism that describes the MBE growth of binary 
oxides such as In2O3, Ga2O3 and SnO232, we empirically modeled the GeO2 growth via the 
intermediate formation of its suboxide GeO. Our measured growth rate as a function of growth 
temperature (TG) and oxygen flux (ΦO) is in good quantitative agreement with this model. The 
growth rate of GeO2 was found to be governed by the competition between GeO2 accumulation 
and GeO desorption as a function of growth parameters.  
Experimental details 
For this study, GeO2 layers were grown on 2-inch diameter, single-side polished, c-plane sapphire 
(Al2O3(0001)) wafers by plasma-assisted MBE (PAMBE). The rough backside of the substrate was 
sputter-coated with titanium to allow for non-contact substrate heating by radiation from the 
substrate heater. The growth temperature was measured with a thermocouple placed between 
the heater and the substrate. A standard shuttered effusion cell was used to evaporate Ge (7N 
purity) from a BN crucible. To avoid the potential cracking of the cell crucible during solidification 
of Ge, the Ge cell was ramped down slowly across the melting point. A radio frequency plasma 
source with a mass flow controller supplied activated oxygen from the research-grade O2 gas (6N 
purity). The beam equivalent pressure (BEP), proportional to the particle flux, was measured by 
a nude filament ion gauge positioned at the substrate location. A Ge cell temperature of 1300oC 
was maintained throughout the experiments and the corresponding BEPs as function of cell 
temperature are shown in Fig S1. The BEPs are given in units of mbar and are converted into the 
equivalent particle flux (atoms nm-2s-1) by multiplying the measured growth rate of the GeO2 
layer under conditions of full Ge incorporation by the cation number density33.  A value of 
2.4x1022 cm-3 for rutile GeO2 is used, and the full Ge incorporation is ensured by growing in the 
oxygen-rich regime and at low substrate temperature of 300 oC where GeO or Ge desorption are 
negligible, a fixed Ge flux of ՓGe= 4.06 nm-2s-1 was obtained based on the measured growth rate 
of 1.7 Å/s (corresponding to 612 nm/h). The oxygen-rich regime was identified by measuring the 
growth rate as function of oxygen flux and will be discussed below. The radio frequency power 
of the plasma source was maintained at 300 W and the oxygen mass flow was set to 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 
1.5 and 2.0, standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), respectively. These oxygen flows were 
converted to active oxygen fluxes (in atoms nm-2s-1) by multiplying the growth rate at 
stochiometric flux conditions with anion number density as described in Ref.[33]. In a separate 
experiment, we attempted to use molecular oxygen to oxidize Ge and found that the molecular 
oxygen was not reactive enough to form GeO2 even at a high flow of 2 sccm.  
In-situ laser reflectometry (LR) with a laser emitting at a wavelength of 650 nm at an incident 
angle of 30 degrees was used to measure the growth and etch rates for all layers. Using this laser, 
one oscillation period corresponds to a change of layer thickness by 200 nm taking into account 
the refractive index of our films of 1.6 as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. The flux of 

===== Page 4 =====

desorbing species during growth and etching was measured in-situ by line-of-sight quadrupole 
mass spectrometry (QMS). The QMS signal was converted into the equivalent growth rate by 
scaling it to reference conditions (high temperature of 800oC with 1 sccm plasma-activated 
oxygen flow) where the provided Ge flux completely desorbed as GeO. Further, growth was insitu monitored by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), which allowed us to 
corroborate our interpretation of the QMS and LR measurements.  
The GeO2 phase was identified ex-situ by Raman spectra acquired after growth using a Horiba 
LabRAM Evolution 800 mm Spectrograph with 473 nm laser excitation in backscattering 
geometry. The refractive index, required for the LR growth-rate-calibration, was determined by 
spectroscopic ellipsometry using a variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer based on a grating 
monochromator equipped with an auto retarder, in the range from 2500-250nm (∼0.5-5eV). This 
measurement yields the amplitude ratio between the parallel and perpendicular component of 
the reflected polarized light from the sample with respect to the plane of incidence (Ψ) and the 
corresponding phase shift between these components (Δ). From this the refractive index n and 
the extinction coefficient k were determined, using a multi-layer model which contained a model 
refractive index n(ħω) of the c-plane Al2O3 substrate layer34 and the GeO2 layer of interest and as 
top layer an effective medium approximated surface roughness layer based on a model by 
Bruggeman.35 The refractive index was extracted based on a Cauchy model.36 
 
Results and discussion  
Figure 1(a) presents the reflected laser intensity measured by LR as a function of time during 
the GeO2 growth and its subsequent etching by Ge. The two observed oscillatory periods, of 
growth (under Ge and activated oxygen flux, “(i)”—“(ii)”) and etching (under Ge flux only, 
starting at (iii)), allow us to determine the growth and etch rate. Figure 1(b) shows the species 
desorbing off the substrate measured in-situ by QMS during a similar growth and etching 
experiment. Here the applied TG was 300oC while the oxygen flux was 8.12 nm-2s-1. Under this 
oxygen-rich and low TG condition, the provided Ge flux did not result in any appreciable 
desorbing cation or suboxide flux, implying the full incorporation of the Ge into the oxide film. 
In the process of etching, the substrate temperature (Tsub) was increased to 700oC to facilitate 
GeO desorption. While the film is stable at this temperature in vacuum (invariant LR signal in 
Figure 1 (a) and negligible QMS signal in Figure 1 (b) directly before (iii)), the impinging Ge 
atoms decompose the already grown GeO2 layer, resulting in a reduction of its thickness 
(oscillation starting at (iii) in Figure 1 (a)) and a sharp increase of the GeO desorbing flux (seen 
in Figure 1 (b)). During etching, the detected Ge signal is an artifact of the fragmentation of GeO 
molecules by the electrons of the ionizer of the QMS. The grown GeO2 layer could be etched 
down to the substrate, which is indicated by a disappearing GeO and an increased Ge desorbing 
flux in Figure 1(b)) and by reappearance of the streaky RHEED pattern of the sapphire substrate 
(Figure 2).

Figure 2. Evolution of the RHEED pattern during growth and subsequent in-situ etching of GeO2: 
(a) c-plane sapphire substrate after oxygen plasma cleaning before growth; (b) after growth of 
an amorphous GeO2 layer at 300°C and (c) after subsequent etching of the layer at 700°C by Ge. 
The net reactions for the growth and etching are, Ge(g) + 2O(g)  GeO2(s) and Ge (g) + GeO2(s) 
 2GeO(g), respectively. The gas and solid phases are labeled as g and s, respectively. Here, the 
same proportion of Ge is required to grow and etch the same amount of GeO2 layer, therefore 
the etch rate was equal to the growth rate (cf. Figure 1(a)). These findings are in accordance with 
the PAMBE growth and etching of SnO2 mediated by its suboxide SnO.37  
The intensity and absence of diffraction spots or streaks in the RHEED image (Figure 2(b)) of the 
GeO2 layer grown at 300°C indicates formation of the amorphous GeO2 phase. The same holds 
true for a multi-layer sample grown at 500°C and 600°C, using several different O-fluxes at each 
temperature to extract the growth kinetics. Ex-situ Raman spectroscopy and spectroscopic 
ellipsometry confirmed the formation of GeO2 in the amorphous phase (Figs. S2, S3) and allowed 
us to extract the refractive index of 1.6 at the wavelength of our LR (see Fig. S3).   
The LR signal of this multilayer sample is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 4. GeO2 growth rate (Γ) measured by LR and GeO desorption rate (γ) simultaneously 
measured by QMS at different TG as a function of activated oxygen flux ՓO. The Ge flux is fixed 
at ՓGe=4.06 nm-2s-1, corresponding to a growth rate of 1.7 Å/s at full Ge incorporation, i.e., for 
Γ=ՓGe. The lines are guides to the eye. 
  
The GeO2 growth rates and corresponding GeO desorption rates for the layers of this sample are 
shown in Figure 4 as a function of ΦO at different TG. At TG of 500 oC and 600 oC, the growth rate 
increases with increasing ΦO until it reached a plateau in the oxygen-rich regime. Under the 
oxygen-deficient condition, i.e., before the plateau, the given active oxygen flux is not sufficient 
to oxidize all the provided Ge flux to GeO2. For instance, an oxygen flux of 4.06 O-atoms nm-2s-1 
is equal to the supplied Ge flux, conforming to the stoichiometric ratio of the suboxide. The 
provided oxygen and Ge flux would thus form GeO. Depending on the specific growth 
temperature, the GeO could desorb (at ≥600°C in our case) or (partially) attach to the substrate 
(at 500°C in our case). The oxygen-deficiency-induced formation of the volatile suboxide can be 
evidenced by a decreasing GeO desorption rate as ΦO increases.

In addition, it is apparent that the growth rate of GeO2 is strongly temperature sensitive: At fixed 
ΦO and ΦGe, the growth rate decreases as TG increases from 500oC to 600°C and growth 
completely ceases at 700°C. This holds true even under oxygen-rich flux ratios and confirms the 
increased thermally activated GeO desorption with increasing TG. For all growth conditions 
employed, the GeO-desorption equals the difference between the impinging Ge flux and the 
GeO2 growth rate, i.e., any Ge that is not incorporated into the GeO2 film desorbs as GeO. 
In a previous study32, a two-step reaction mechanism was established to describe the MBE 
growth of binary oxides like In2O3, Ga2O3 and SnO2, in which the metal (e.g., Ga, In, Sn) oxidized 
to form a suboxide (e.g., Ga2O, In2O, SnO) via a first oxidization step and the suboxide further 
oxidized to form the solid metal oxide via a second oxidization step. Analogously, we applied this 
model to the growth of GeO2. In this case, the first oxidization step is:  
Ge(g) + O (g)  GeO(s). 
The second oxidation step is: 
GeO(s)  GeO2(s)  
and competes with the thermally activated suboxide desorption  
GeO(s)  GeO(g). 
Since GeO2 and SnO2 as well as their suboxides exhibit the same stoichiometry, we used the same 
rate equation for the chemical reaction and desorption of SnO2 for the growth of GeO2: 
Г = 
1
2 (ϒ + 𝛷O - √ϒ2 + 2ϒ𝛷𝑂+ (2𝛷𝐺𝑒−𝛷𝑂)2 )                         (1) 
in which ϒ = ΦGe - Г, representing the suboxide desorption rate, and ϒ can be further expressed 
as (related factorization and simplification can be seen in the Ref.32):  
                                                  ϒ (𝑅, 𝑇𝐺) = ϒ0𝑒
−(𝐸𝑎(𝑅)
𝐾𝐵𝑇𝐺)                                                        (2) 
here, ϒ0 = e37.2 , which is obtained  by fitting the related vapor pressure data of the suboxide from 
literature and by converting the pressure to flux unit38, R is the ratio of ΦGe/ΦO, KB is Boltzmann 
constant, the activation energy value Ea is the only free parameter. Performing least-square fit of 
Eq. (1) to the Г of GeO2 as a function of TG (Figure 5(b)), we are able to obtain Ea as shown in Fig. 
S4, the value is linearly dependent on R:  
                                                    𝐸𝑎(𝑅) = 𝐸0 −𝜁𝑅                                                                 (3) 
By applying Eq. (3) and Eq. (2) to Eq. (1), Г of GeO2 can be modeled quantitatively as a function 
of TG and ΦO. The resulting model curves presented in Figure 5, are in good agreement withour 
measured growth rates as a function of TG and ΦO. The two-step oxidation model, thus, physically 
and quantitatively describes the PAMBE growth kinetics of GeO2.

in Fig. S5 and Fig. S6. Based on these calculated results we extract the predicted regions of

Figure 6. The PAMBE growth diagram of GeO2 illustrating the growth window as a function of 
O-to-Ge flux ratio and TG modelled for the fixed Ge-flux of 4.06 nm-2s-1 used in our growth 
experiments. Horizontal lines separate the flux stoichiometry regions that enable O-rich growth, 
Ge-rich growth, and layer etching by Ge as labeled. The region of predicted condensation of 
secondary GeO phases into the film is marked by a hatched pattern and includes a star-shaped 
data point that corresponds to a condition in which we found condensation of GeO in our 
experiments. This growth diagram can also apply to the growth of GeO2 by using GeO cell, 
which bypasses the intermediate formation of suboxide on the substrate, a case can be seen in 
ref [24]. 
 
The predicted GeO2-growth window thus comprises the regions of full (blue shaded) and partial 
(red shaded) incorporation, whereas the grey-shaded region denotes the no-growth region. Full 
Ge-incorporation into GeO2 can be found only in the ΦO/ΦGe≥2-region (O-rich flux stoichiometry) 
at sufficiently low TG that prevents desorption of the intermediately-formed GeO. At a Ge-rich 
flux stoichiometry (1<ΦO/ΦGe<2) the growth of pure GeO2 is only possible at TG low enough 
(≤637°C in our example) to prevent full GeO desorption but high enough to prevent condensation 
secondary GeO-phases into the film. Impeded GeO desorption can, for example, explain the finite 
growth rate (of GeO) in Figure 4 and Figure 5(a) at ΦO/ΦGe=1 (ΦO=4.06 nm-2s-1) and TG=500oC --  
these conditions are marked by the star-shaped datapoint in Figure 6.

 Finally, at ΦO/ΦGe<1 the fraction of provided Ge not oxidized into GeO can etch the GeO2 film.  
Lower(higher) ΦGe would shift the non-horizontal boundaries Figure 6 to lower(higher) 
temperatures to account for the decreased(increased) absolute GeO desorption. Since GeO 
desorption and oxidation into GeO2 are also the main processes in suboxide MBE (providing a 
GeO instead of Ge flux) of GeO2,24 we conjecture our growth diagram to cover this growth 
method as well when offsetting the flux-ratio scale to account for absent consumption of O for 
the GeO formation. This scenario is described by the right-hand-side scale in Figure 6 and 
precludes layer etching, since this would require supply of an elemental Ge flux. 
Summary and Conclusion 
We have investigated the Ge incorporation and the competing desorption of its suboxide GeO 
during the growth of amorphous GeO2 by plasma-assisted MBE from an elemental Ge source. 
The growth rate and desorbing flux were measured in-situ by laser reflectometry and line-ofsight quadrupole mass spectroscopy, respectively. For a detailed understanding of the reaction 
kinetics of GeO2, the growth rate dependence on growth temperatures and oxygen fluxes was 
studied systematically. A Ge flux in the absence of oxygen lead to a negative growth rate, i.e., 
etching of the GeO2 film. We generally demonstrated, that growth rates lower than the provided 
Ge flux were caused by GeO desorption driven by oxygen-deficiency or high temperatures. This 
behaviour was physically and quantitatively explained by a two-step oxidization model via the 
intermediate formation of GeO in good quantitative agreement with the measured growth rate 
as a function of all the studied growth parameters. Based on our results, we established a diagram 
describing the growth window and different growth regimes in parameter space spanned by OGe flux ratio and growth temperature.  
We conclude, that our growth-kinetics study and the resulting growth diagram (Figure 6) can 
serve as a guidance for the thin film synthesis of all phases of GeO2, since the oxidation reactions 
and GeO desorption are phase-independent. Potentially different surface free energies of 
crystalline GeO2 phases, would be reflected by a different activation energy Ea for GeO desorption 
and correspondingly re-scaled absolute temperatures in Figure 6.  
We further conjecture our findings to also apply to the growth of GeO2 by ozone- or suboxideMBE. For all these flavors of MBE, O-rich growth conditions are recommended to (a) prevent 
condensation of secondary GeO phases into the film at low substrate temperature, and (b) 
prevent excessive GeO desorption at high substrate temperature. Ge-rich condition, on the other 
hand, may impact surface faceting (as observed during the MBE of In2O3)39 or Ge/O-vacancy 
formation. Stabilization of crystalline phases of GeO2 should be enabled by the choice of 
substrate or buffer layer (e.g., rutile-TiO2 or rutile-SnO2 for the growth of r-GeO2)40,41 likely within 
a limited, not too O-rich region41 of the growth window.

Finally, the in-situ etching of GeO2 by Ge, at elevated temperatures that enable GeO desorption, 
provides the potential for damage-free mesa etching in future GeO2-device formation, a process 
already demonstrated for the case of Ga2O3 etched by Ga.42

Figure S2. Corresponding Raman spectrum of the GeO2 film described in Figure 3 as well as 
reference spectra measured for a pure sapphire substrate and amorphous GeO2 from Ref. 16. 
Excellent agreement of the broad feature can be found with the reference spectrum of a-GeO2 
while the observed sharp peaks are originated from the sapphire substrate. 
 
Figure S3. Average refractive index of the GeO2 stack described in Figure 3 based on a Cauchy 
model (red) in comparison with experimental results of amorphous GeO2 by Pajasova43 (blue), of 
rutile GeO2 by Weber44 (black), and theoretical calculations of rutile GeO2 by Mengle et al. 12 
(green). In case of rutile GeO2, both the ordinary (E⊥c) (solid) and the extraordinary component 
(E||c) (dashed) are displayed. The extracted extinction coefficient k of the GeO2 stack was zero in 
the whole measurement range.
