Introductory Note 
 
Segmented silicon detectors (microstrip and pixel devices) are widely used in High Energy Physics 
applications. Due to their unsurpassed quality they play a major role in the tracking area of present and future 
collider experiments. However in the forthcoming experiments at LHC and TESLA they are subject to extremely 
harsh hadronic resp. electromagnetic radiation environments thus threatening their operability. 
 
In the past years considerable effort had been undertaken in order to improve the radiation tolerance of these 
devices and thus guarantee an operational lifetime of e.g. 10 years in the LHC inner detector. Most of this work 
had been carried out by the CERN-RD48 (ROSE) collaboration (1996-2000).  It had been shown that radiation 
damage effects in silicon detectors could be considerably reduced by using a defect engineering approach, 
consisting in an oxygen enrichment of the float zone wafers during detector processing. This technique is now 
employed e.g. in the ATLAS pixel and part of the strip layers. In future experiments like for an upgraded LHC 
(SLHC) the present luminosity of 1034 is envisioned to be increased by a factor of 10 and hence a hadronic 
fluence integrated over the operational period will reach 1016 equivalent n/cm². Presently there are no techniques 
available to ensure the necessary radiation tolerance of tracking detectors up to such high values. Possible 
improvements of the ROSE results as well as completely new approaches are necessary and will be the goal of 
the newly founded R&D collaboration CERN-RD50. 
 
Our group is engaged in long term R&D projects in the development and radiation hardness of silicon 
detectors. The group participated in  RD48 and is presently also a member of RD50. Our main object is the 
systematic investigation of damage consequences for the operation of silicon detectors and its complete 
understanding. Although considerable improvement had been achieved in the systematic analysis of radiation 
induced changes of macroscopic detector properties only little was gained so far in the correlation with 
responsible defects on the microscopic scale. The first paper in this report gives an overview of the present 
knowledge as resulting largely from RD48-experiments and recent own upgrades for hadron induced damage. 
Both confirmed results showing the improvements to be gained by the oxygen enrichment as also still open 
questions in the available systematics are covered. As hadronic interactions give rise to both “cluster” and “point 
defects” in silicon, low energy electromagnetic irradiation can only produce point defects, offering a much more 
direct correlation between defect generation and detector performance. All other 3 papers are dealing with this 
issue. In the second one we investigate existing point defects in as processed detectors and additional defect 
formation after gamma irradiation. The last two paper are concentrating on a close correlation between gamma 
induced deep defects and their consequences for the detector performance. For the very first time it is shown that 
both the change of the effective doping concentration (depletion voltage) and the free charge carrier generation 
(reverse current) can be completely understood by the microscopically investigated formation of deep defects, 
largely suppressed by oxygen enrichment. This is regarded to be a major breakthrough for the long searched for 
understanding of radiation damage and will hopefully also pave the road for an optimum of radiation tolerant 
detectors including hadronic damage. 
 
The Work of our group is supported by the DFG (German Research Foundation) and BMBF (Ministry for 
Research). Part of the work had been performed in collaboration with industry (CiS Erfurt), supported by the 
BMWI (Ministry for Economy).

Abstract 
Radiation damage effects in silicon detectors under severe hadron- and γ–irradiation are surveyed, focusing on 
bulk effects. Both macroscopic detector properties (reverse current, depletion voltage and charge collection) as 
also the underlying microscopic defect generation are covered. Basic results are taken from the work done in the 
CERN-RD48 (ROSE) collaboration updated by results of recent work. Preliminary studies on the use of 
dimerized float zone and Czochralski silicon as detector material show possible benefits. An essential progress in 
the understanding of the radiation induced detector deterioration had recently been achieved in gamma 
irradiation, directly correlating defect analysis data with the macroscopic detector performance.

1. Introduction 
Silicon pixel and microstrip detectors are today’s 
best choices for meeting the requirements of tracking 
applications in the forthcoming LHC experiments. 
However, due to the extreme harsh radiation 
environment the required prolonged operability poses 
an unprecedented challenge to their radiation 
tolerance. At the expected yearly level of up to 
several 1014 hadrons per cm² during the foreseen 10 
years of operation the damage induced changes in the 
silicon bulk will cause an increase of both the reverse 
current and the necessary depletion voltage as well as 
a decrease of the charge collection efficiency. Using 
standard silicon material and present detector 
technology these damage induced effects lead to not 
tolerable deteriorations in the detector performance. 
Possible strategies for improving the radiation 
hardness of these devices consist of using suitable 
defect engineering of the silicon material,  as 
introduced 
by 
the 
CERN-RD48 
(ROSE) 
collaboration [1], operation at very low temperatures 
under investigation by the CERN-RD39 group [2] or 
a specialized design of detector geometry, presently 
proposed or under test by several other groups, see 
e.g. [3] and literature cited there.  
This report is based on the results of the ROSE 
collaboration showing the appreciable improvements 
which had been achieved by diffusing oxygen from 
the SiO2-Si interface into the silicon bulk after initial 
oxidation of the silicon wafers. This so called DOFZ 
(Diffusion Oxygenated Float Zone) technology had 
proven to be the most cost effective way of 
adequately 
modifying 
the 
standard 
process 
technology (see section 4.1).  
In the following different aspects  of hadron and 
gamma/lepton 
induced 
bulk 
damage 
effects, 
originating from the Non Ionizing Energy Loss 
(NIEL) are summarized, especially comparing 
standard with oxygenated silicon detectors, as 
extracted from numerous publications of the ROSE 
collaboration [4]. In contrast to bulk effects surface 
and interface related changes, produced by the 
ionizing energy loss (radiation dose), play a minor 
role for lifetime limitations of silicon detectors. The 
discussion of such effects can e.g. be found in [5]. 
2.  Primary damage effects  
The bulk damage in silicon detectors caused by  
hadrons or higher energetic leptons respectively 
gammas is primarily due to displacing a Primary 
Knock on Atom PKA out of its lattice site. The 
threshold energy for this process is ~ 25 eV. Such 
single displacements resulting in a pair of a silicon 
interstitial and a vacancy (Frenkel pair) can be 
generated by e.g. neutrons or electrons with an 
energy above 175 eV and 260 keV respectively. Low 
energy recoils above these threshold energies will 
usually create fixed point defects. However for recoil 
energies above about 5 keV a dense agglomeration of 
defects is formed at the end of the primary PKA 
track. Such disordered regions are referred to as 
defect clusters. The kinematic lower limits for the 
production of clusters are ~35 keV for neutrons and 
~8 MeV for electrons. In figure 1 the simulation 
result for a 50 keV PKA (average recoil produced by 
1 MeV neutrons) is shown, clearly  distinguishing 
between discretely distributed vacancies (point 
defects) and dense agglomerates (clusters) [6]. It 
should be noted here that the radiation damage 
caused by Co-60 gammas is primarily due to the 
interaction of Compton electrons having a maximum 
energy of only 1 MeV. Hence in this case cluster 
production is not possible and the damage is 
exclusively due to point defects.

Both point defects and clusters can have severe 
effects on the detector performance, depending on 
their concentration, energy level and the respective 
electron and hole capture cross section. Defects with 
deep energy levels in the middle of the forbidden gap 
could act as recombination/generation centers and are 
hence responsible for an increase of the reverse 
detector current. The removal of dopants by 
formation of complex defects as well as the 
generation of charged centers changes the effective 
doping concentration and the needed operating 
voltage to fully deplete the detector thickness. Finally 
such defects could also act as trapping centers 
affecting the charge collection efficiency.  In view of 
the LHC operational scenario it has also to be noted 
that the primary produced defects may be subject to 
changes after long term storage at room temperature. 
Such annealing effects may very likely be caused by 
changes due to the dissolution of clusters releasing 
migrating vacancies and interstitials [7]. The 
observed time constants for such “reverse annealing” 
processes are rather large (for standard silicon at 
room temperature e.g. ~ 1year).  A reliable projection 
of damage results on the LHC operational scenario is 
hence only possible if annealing effects are included 
comparable to those expected in 10 years of LHC 
operation.  This task had been successfully attacked 
by performing studies at elevated temperatures thus 
accelerating the kinetic effects being responsible for 
such long term changes. Related basic studies are 
found in [8-10]. 
3.  NIEL scaling of bulk damage 
The 
preceding 
discussion 
and 
numerous 
experimental observations have led to the assumption 
that damage effects produced in the silicon bulk by 
energetic particles can be described as being 
proportional to the so called displacement damage 
cross section D. This quantity is equivalent to the 
Non Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) and hence the 
proportionality between the NIEL-value and the 
resulting damage effects is referred to as the NIELscaling hypothesis (for deviations to this rule see 
section 4.5.1). The displacement damage cross 
section D is normally quantified in MeVmb, whereas 
the NIEL-value is given in keVcm²/g.  For silicon 
with A=28.086 g/mol the relation between D and 
NIEL is:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Non ionising energy loss NIEL for different particles. 
100 MeVmb = 2.144 keVcm²/g. The D or NIEL 
value is depending on the particle type and energy. 
According to an ASTM standard, the displacement 
damage cross section  for 1 MeV neutrons is set as a 
normalizing value: Dn(1MeV) = 95 MeVmb [11]. On 
the basis of the NIEL scaling the damage efficiency 
of any particle with a given kinetic energy  can then 
be described by the hardness factor κ. Applying the 
NIEL hypothesis, one may replace the actual particle 
energy spectrum dΦ/dE by a NIEL folded spectrum 
and the damage effect, caused by its total fluence Φp 
by a 1MeV neutron equivalent fluence  Φeq = κ . Φp, a 
more detailed discussion is found in [12, 13].

In figure 2 the normalized NIEL values are 
plotted as function of energy. The data are taken from 
[14-17]. More recent calculations can be found in [6],  
[18]. NIEL scaling and its limitations is extensively 
discussed in [6]. Regardless of possible deviations in 
certain cases, the NIEL scaling should always be 
applied as a first order approximation of  the damage 
efficiency. Hence it is useful to display the NIEL 
folded energy spectra for the most abundant particles 
(neutrons and pions) in the LHC experiments, as 
done for the SCT region of ATLAS in figure 3 [12]. 
Finally the resulting equivalent fluences as function 
of radius are shown in figure 4.  
From figure 3 we conclude that reactor neutrons, 
ranging mainly from 1 to 10 MeV, are adequate for 
reliable damage tests and that indeed irradiations with 
250 MeV pions, available at PSI-Villigen, should 
result in similar damage as expected in LHC. Many 
of the past and present irradiation tests have however 
been performed using the 23 GeV proton beam at 
CERN-PS. In view of reliable predictions for the 
LHC performance it is therefore reassuring that 
damage results from 23 GeV proton and 250 MeV 
pion irradiation agree pretty well, if proper NIEL 
scaling is used.

4.  Survey of damage results 
4.1.   DOFZ technology 
The key idea of the RD48 strategy implied that 
the  radiation tolerance of silicon can be improved by 
adequate defect engineering. Defect engineering 
involves the deliberate addition of impurities in order 
to reduce the damage induced formation of 
electrically active defects. Based on early attempts at 
the Instrumentation Division of BNL [19], RD48 
relied on carbon and oxygen as the key ingredients 
for reaching this goal [1]. A wide range of oxygen 
and carbon concentrations had been investigated 
using several different process technologies.  
It was finally found that an oxygen enrichment 
can best be achieved by a post-oxidation diffusion of 
oxygen into the silicon bulk. This DOFZ process 
(Diffusion Oxygenated Float Zone) has been 
performed at temperatures between 1100 and 1200°C 
and with durations between several hours and 10 
days, reaching an oxygen concentration between 1 
and 4.1017 O/cm³ (see also figure 23). 
Practical applications are employing a diffusion at 
1150°C for 24-72h. The O-concentration reached this 
way is around 2.1017 O/cm³, see figure 5.

processes, from bottom: 24, 48, 72 h at 1150 ºC; in comparison:

It should be emphasized that the DOFZ process can 
easily be included in the standard detector process

technology and had proven to be a most cost effective 
technique. It was meanwhile successfully transferred 
to several manufacturing companies, see [22] and is 
e.g. employed in the design and processing of pixel 
and microstrip detectors for the ATLAS experiment 
[23]. 
 
4.2.   bulk generation current 
The damage induced increase of the bulk 
generation current ∆I exhibits a quite simple 
dependence on the irradiating particle type and 
fluence. 
If normalized to the sensitive volume V (best 
defined by using a guard ring structure around the 
diode 
pad), 
the 
current 
increase 
is 
strictly 
proportional to the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence 
Φeq (see section 3), as demonstrated in figure 6 [10]. 
Therefore a “current related damage rate α” can be 
defined by: 
∆I/V = αּΦeq  
(1) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 6. Damage induced bulk current as function of particle fluence 
for different detector types. 
The measured value of the reverse current 
depends exponentially on the operating temperature 
in a straight forward way and α-values are therefore 
always normalized to 20°C. Details for this 
normalization 
and 
the 
temperature 
dependent 
beneficial annealing, depicted in figure 7, can be 
found in [10, 24]. At any given temperature and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7. Annealing function of current related damage parameter α 
for standard (solid line) and DOFZ (dots) silicon detectors. 
annealing time the damage rate α, if temperature 
normalized, is a universal constant, not depending on 
the material type (n- or p-type, FZ, epi or Cz silicon, 
resistivity), or irradiating particles (neutrons, protons, 
pions). Therefore α is often used to reliably monitor 
the accumulated particle fluence. A recommendation 
for this task is its measurement after an annealing of 
80 min at 60°C. In this situation α is independent of 
the detailed history of the actual irradiation. The 
ROSE adapted value is: α80/60 = 4.0.10-17 A/cm. For 
an annealing temperature of 80°C the same value 
would be reached after an annealing time of ~10 
minutes [10, 25].  
It should be emphasized that the  bulk current 
increase and its annealing function follow strictly the 
NIEL scaling. This and the observation, that the large 
current values cannot be explained by any known 
discrete point defects led to the assumption of a 
cluster related effect. The correlation with the 
enhanced density of double vacancies in clusters as 
observed in [25] and a possible interstate charge 
transfer mechanism, as proposed in [26], are likely 
explanations.     
4.3.   effective doping and depletion voltage

extend the electric field throughout the depth d of the 
detector (asymmetric junction) is related with the

This equation holds not only for the original ntype silicon (donor doped) but also after severe 
irradiation when the effective doping concentration 
changes its sign by increased generation of “acceptor 
like” defects. In any case one can describe the change 
of the depletion voltage by the related change in |Neff| 
= |Nd – Na| with Nd and Na as the positively charged 
donor and negatively charged acceptor concentration.

The result of a first systematic study of the 
extremely large change of  |Neff| as measured 
immediately after irradiation of  standard silicon 
detectors is depicted in  figure 8 [8]. The not tolerable 
increase of the needed depletion voltage after “type 
inversion” had then been the major impact for 
radiation hardening. 
 
4.3.1.   CERN-scenario measurements 
In real applicational scenarios damage induced 
“immediate” changes of Neff  as displayed in figure 8 
will 
always 
be 
connected 
with 
subsequent 
“annealing” effects. It was therefore found useful to 
devise an almost online possibility for rapidly 
comparing the radiation tolerance between different 
materials, taking the yearly expected annealing into 
account. The so called CERN-scenario experiments 
consist of consecutive irradiation steps with a short

term annealing in between [27]. The annealing steps 
(4 minutes at 80°C) are chosen such that the observed 
change in Neff corresponds to what would be expected 
after about 10 days at 20°C. Thus the operational 
LHC scenario can be approximated this way. The 
chosen annealing time corresponds also to the 
minimum of the annealing curve as measured for 
80ºC and is therefore closely related to the “stable 
component” of the change in Neff  (see below). 
Figure 9 shows a comparison between standard, 
carbon- and oxygen enriched silicon as irradiated by 
23 GeV protons at the CERN PS irradiation facility 
[27]. It is clearly seen, that the O-enrichment reduces 
the change in Neff and likewise in the depletion 
voltage considerably to about 1/3 of that for standard 
silicon while carbon-enrichment proves to have an 
adverse effect. However, although pion and proton

irradiation exhibit the same superiority of DOFZ 
material, neutron damage does not result in a similar 
improvement, see figure 10 [27]. This discrepancy 
with the simple NIEL scaling assumption (section 3) 
is often been referred to as the “p-n-puzzle”. A 
discussion  of this point will be given in section 4.5.1. 
4.3.2. Annealing experiments and modeling 
As already mentioned, the CERN scenario tests 
allow only the measurement of one relevant damage 
parameter,  namely the change of the effective doping 
concentration around the minimum of the annealing 
function. A different but much more time consuming 
approach, introduced by the Hamburg group, uses a 
set of diodes which are irradiated individually with 
different fluences and are then subjected to full 
annealing cycles at an elevated temperature for 
accelerating the annealing kinetics (see [13] and 
literature cited there). The result of such an annealing 
experiment is shown in figure 11. ∆Neff  is the 
damage induced change in the effective doping 
concentration: 
∆Neff(Φeq, t(Ta)) = Neff,0 -Neff(Φeq, t(Ta)) 
(3) 
As function of the equivalent fluence Φeq and the 
annealing time t at temperature T ∆Neff  can be 
described as: 
∆Neff = NA(Φeq, t(Ta)) + NC(Φeq) + NY(Φeq, t(Ta)) (4) 
∆Neff  consists of three components, a short term 
beneficial annealing NA, a stable damage part NC and 
the reverse annealing component NY. Both time 
constants for the beneficial as well as reverse 
annealing depend strongly on the temperature. A 
more detailed discussion can be found in [10, 13]. 
Recent results for the stable damage component NC 
have shown that there is no pronounced difference 
between a moderate 24 h and an enlarged 72 h 
oxygen diffusion and in fact the improvement with 
respect to standard material is also only marginal as 
to be seen in figure 12 [20]. This surprising effect 
will be further discussed in section 4.6. 
A much more general behavior regarding the 
DOFZ benefits is seen for the reverse annealing 
amplitude. Standard silicon reveals an almost linear 
behavior of the reverse annealing amplitude NY with 
fluence while DOFZ silicon shows strong saturation

at large fluences. This effect as well as an observed 
increased time constant [1, 20] offer an additional 
safety margin for detectors kept at room temperatures 
every year during maintenance periods. As shown in 
[20] and documented in figure 13, the difference 
between 24 and 72 h O-diffusion is again not very 
large. It is however interesting that there are, contrary 
to previous investigations, also some benefits after 
neutron irradiation.

flunence after n- (open symbols) and PS-p-irradiation (filled

for the standard process [20]. 
With all parameters of eq. (4) it is then possible to 
calculate the expected change of the necessary 
depletion voltage throughout prolonged operation in 
any given hadron radiation environment. Such 
projections on the 10 year LHC operational scenario

are finally shown in figure 14. It is obvious that only 
the DOFZ method guarantees the required lifetime 
expectancy of 10 years for the innermost pixel layer 
of the ATLAS experiment (see also [23]). It should 
however be emphasized that the damage projection 
shown here is based on the parameters listed in [1]

thus may underestimate the beneficial DOFZ effect 
according to recent results as shown in figure 13 (see 
also [20]). The actual values seem also to depend on 
the individual manufacturing process (see section 
4.5). It should also be mentioned that annealing 
experiments have to include a long known bi-stable 
effect [28]. Thus final conclusions can only be drawn 
after some proper quality assurance check of  the 
actual detectors. 
4.4. Charge collection efficiency 
For any application of silicon detectors in vertex 
detectors the prime focus is on the operating voltage 
needed to guarantee a sufficiently good S/N ratio for 
detection of mip’s. The signal noise is controlled by 
operating the detectors at low temperature (–10°C). 
Such, a good charge collection efficiency is then the 
prime objective. For best performance full depletion 
of the detector thickness is needed and therefore the 
considerations outlined in section 4.3 are of great 
importance.  However, in order to keep trapping and 
ballistic deficit effects low, the operating voltage has 
to be even larger than the depletion voltage.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 15.  Annealing curves as measured from charge collection 
(open symbols) and C/V-measurements (closed ones). 
Measurements of charge collection in test diodes 
have been performed with β-sources and long 
wavelength infrared laser light pulses, which ensure a 
near mip like charge track generation throughout the 
depth of the device (see e.g. [29]). Other experiments 
have used short wavelength IR laser beams 
illuminating the test diode from either p+ or n+ side 
for investigation of the electron resp. hole dominated 
pulse signals separately. This allows the study of 
charge carrier trapping effects and these results could 
then again be included in model calculations for LHC 
or other applications [30-33].

The analysis of charge collection as function of 
bias voltage should, similar to capacitance/voltage 
measurements, also reveal the depletion voltage. It is 
reassuring that in fact both techniques have led to the 
same results (figure 15) [1]. Examples of time 
resolved signal pulse shapes are shown in figure 16 
[1]. The double peaking is attributed to a double

junction structure of the kind p+npn+. This is a 
generally  observed effect and still needs its complete 
explanation, a likely explanation as also other details 
of the signal shape are discussed in [34, 35]. 
The application of charge collection results as 
obtained with test diodes to segmented detectors is 
not straight forward but incorporates  a more complex 
calculation involving the geometrical structure of the 
detector by using a “weighting field”. This point had 
long been neglected and only recently caught more 
attention, for detailed discussion see [36]. 
 
4.5. Microscopic understanding of damage effects 
Systematic studies for defect engineering are 
finally only possible if the correlation between defect 
formation and the detector performance would be 
known. 
Numerous 
investigations 
have 
been 
undertaken for characterization of damage induced 
defects in detector grade silicon, especially using 
DLTS (Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy) and TSC 
(Thermally Stimulated Current) techniques, showing 
a lot of relevant results [9, 10, 25, 37-40]. A 
promising correlation has been reported between the 
cluster formation as visible in the double vacancy 
defect and the damage related current [25]. Other 
studies have given a lot of detailed information of 
defect kinetics visible in the changes during 
prolonged annealing or as function of temperature 
(see e.g. [9, 10, 37]). However despite many partially 
useful attempts it was so far not possible to 
quantitatively fully understand the (macroscopic) 
detector 
performance 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
(microscopic) data. In the following two examples 
are given, which are regarded to be promising in this 
respect. 
4.5.1. p-n puzzle, violation of NIEL scaling 
As outlined in section 3, originally all damage 
effects had been assumed to be simply proportional to 
the displacement damage cross section and hence to 
obey a universal behavior  not depending on the 
particle type and energy if NIEL scaling is applied. 
NIEL scaling is still valid for the damage induced 
bulk generation current of high energy hadron 
irradiated detectors (section 4.2) but is strongly 
violated for the change of the effective doping 
concentration (see section 3, figure 10 and 13).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 17. Generation rates for E2 and E4 as obtained from neutron, 
pion and proton irradiation (see text): g(E2)/g(E4) = 0.6 (5 MeV 
neutrons), 1.0 (192 MeV pions and 23 GeV protons) and 1.3 (27 
MeV protons). 
Although this so called proton-neutron puzzle is 
still not completely understood, the following 
remarks may be useful. Figure 17 shows the 
experimental results of point defect generation rates 
after n-, p- and pion irradiation [25].  The double 
vacancy defect E4 is surely related to cluster 
formation while E2 is composed of the A-center 
(VOi) and a carbon complex (CiCs), both being 
discrete point defects. Therefore the ratio of 
g(E2)/g(E4) measures the point defect generation 
with respect to cluster formation.  These findings 
may be compared with the simulation results shown 
in figure 18 [6].

1 MeV neutron damage is obviously dominated 
by 
the 
production 
of 
cluster 
like 
vacancy 
agglomerates with typical dimensions of 100Å or less 
while high energy protons lead to an additional 
concentration 
of 
isolated 
and 
homogeneously 
distributed vacancies and interstitials, responsible for 
point defects. The p-n-puzzle is just a result of the 
different primary interactions, which are in the case 
of neutrons caused by hard core nuclear scattering 
with energy transfers likely larger than the cluster 
formation threshold of 5 keV. For charged hadrons 
the Coulomb interaction prevails leading to much 
lower recoil energies below the cluster threshold thus  
responsible for more point defects. This clear picture 
may have to be changed if high energy pion or proton 
damage would be compared to that produced by 
neutrons with much larger energies than those 
accessible in reactors. In fact the neutron energy 
spectrum in the inner detector of LHC experiments 
covers a range up to about 100 MeV (figure 3). At 
this energy secondary nuclear reaction products as  
e.g. α-particles, protons and even those with larger 
mass could contribute to low energy recoils due to 
their Coulomb interaction much more than resulting 
from 1 MeV neutrons (elastic nuclear scattering 
only). Thus the p-n-puzzle could  indeed be less 
pronounced if damage studies would be performed 
with higher energetic neutrons. As a result, if the 
DOFZ related benefits are closely related to point 
defect formation as it presently looks (see next 
section), the actual neutron damage for the tracking 
detectors might also be reduced by using DOFZ 
silicon. 
4.5.2. microscopic picture of gamma induced damage 
Although a lot of microscopic investigations on 
defect generation induced by hadron irradiation had 
been performed, it has yet not been possible to relate 
the macroscopic change in Neff to any such defects in 
a quantitative way. The long suspected candidate 
which could explain also the improvement obtained 
by oxygen enrichment is the acceptor like V2Ocenter, a deep defect in the middle of the forbidden 
gap [41]. In contrast to hadron irradiation low energy 
gamma damage leads only to the generation of point 
defects revealing a much cleaner picture not 
complicated by cluster effects. Co-60 γ-irradiation 
studies have shown that the improvement obtained 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 19.  DLTS spectra  showing a close to midgap level at Ea=0.54 
eV (V2O) in standard silicon and suppressed in DOFZ [42, 43]. 
with DOFZ silicon is in this case much more 
pronounced than observed after hadron irradiation 
[42]. Only recently a defect had been measured by 
DLTS and TSC techniques very likely to be 
identified as the  long searched V2O center [43, 44]. 
Its generation is largely suppressed in DOFZ silicon, 
see figure 19. Effective doping concentration does 
not show any type inversion as seen in standard 
material, see figure 20. Using the analyzed defect 
parameters as function of the gamma dose it was then 
shown that both the change in the effective doping 
concentration and reverse current of standard silicon 
detectors can largely be attributed to the generation of 
the V2O center [45]. This result can rightfully be 
regarded as an absolute first in the long and 
sometimes frustrating search for an understanding of 
macroscopic damage effects by defect analysis.

4.6.   Open questions 
Although it looks that the final results have led to 
an almost universal recipe for improving the radiation 
tolerance in a predictable way and a possibility to 
perform projections to any operational scenario, a 
number of problems remain still open.  
One of the most asked questions is: how much 
oxygen is enough? New results suggest that the main 
positive effect is already achievable with a diffusion 
for 24 hours at 1150°C ([20], see figures 12 and 13). 
However such a short diffusion process leads to a 
pronounced non-homogeneity in the depth profile of 
the O-concentration (see figure 5), the effect of which 
is not yet known. A detailed comparison with the 
BNL HTLT (High Temperature Long Time) DOFZ 
process resulting in a homogeneous oxygen depth 
profile would be very interesting [46]. 
Most test damage experiments have been 
performed with irradiations of diodes at room 
temperature and  unbiased and hence much different 
from the actual situation. Only in a few cases the real 
operational conditions (-10ºC and under bias) had 
been included. Examples are reported e.g. in [47], 
[48]. More systematic studies are needed, especially 
with proton resp. pion irradiation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 21.  Stable damage component for DOFZ detectors from 
different material, manufactured by ST Microelectronics (Italy). 
A worrying result of principal importance is 
illustrated in figures 21 and 22 [49]. CERN scenario 
experiments with different material have shown that 
the “stable damage” component as function of 
fluence varies widely for standard FZ silicon (figure 
21), whereas for DOFZ silicon  the variations are 
small (figure 22). The results, shown here only for 
diodes of one manufacturer, are much more generally  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 22. Same as in Fig. 21 but for various DOFZ silicon. 
Valid, including different sources. A likely reason for 
the effect could be a different carbon content. 
Reliable material characterization before and after 
processing will be essential.

different DOFZ processes at various manufacturers: ST: ST 
Microelectronics (Italy), SINTEF (Norway), CiS (Germany). The 
bottom 2 curves are for a standard oxidation process, all others 
diffusion oxygenated as labelled. 
Another riddle is displayed in figures 23 and 24 
[50]. Here the correlation between the oxygen 
enrichment and its results for the saturation of the 
reverse annealing is demonstrated. In general one 
observes the expected effect: a larger O-concentration 
leads to lower reverse annealing amplitudes. E.g. the  
standard ST Microelectronics process (bottom most 
curve in figure 23) reveals the lowest Oconcentration and shows the largest NY values (top

curve in figure 24). Also the ST-process with the 
largest O-concentration (30h at 1200°C, top curve in 
figure 23) results in the best reverse annealing 
performance (bottom most curve in figure 24). 
Although the CiS process (16h at 1150°C, 3rd curve 
from bottom in figure 23) and the SINTEF process 
(72 resp. 80h at 1150°C, 4th and 5th from bottom in 
figure 23) show the expected difference in the Oconcentration , the reverse annealing obtained with 
the CiS diodes (2nd from bottom in figure 24) is better 
than that for the SINTEF process (3rd and 4th from 
bottom in figure 24). This quite confusing result may 
be understood by differences induced from the 
individual process. Characterization of the material 
after processing is therefore urgently needed, an 
example is given in [51]. 
5. Recent studies for improvements  
The normal oxygen enrichment via the DOFZ 
process makes use of the diffusion of oxygen present 
as single atoms on interstial lattice sites. A 
modification had been introduced by the Brunel 
group generating oxygen dimers (2 closely related 
interstitial O-atoms). First damage studies with such 
material have shown promising results with evidence 
for the reduction of cluster related damage [52]. 
 The BNL group, using their HTLT technique 
have additionally doped the material with thermal 
donors. An appreciable improvement had been 
reported showing no increase of the stable damage 
component of Neff at proton fluences above 2⋅1014 
p/cm² [46]. 
Finally the Hamburg group had performed 
damage tests with diodes fabricated from high 
resistivity  Czochralski silicon, which has an as 
grown O-concentration of 8⋅1017/cm³ (see also figure 
5), much larger than possible with any DOFZ 
process. First damage experiments with pion and 
proton irradiation have shown no type inversion after 
large fluences, an effect which is in contrast to all FZ 
results and could indeed be very profitable for 
detector applications [20]. 
6. Conclusions 
• Diffusion oxygenation of float zone silicon 
(DOFZ) has proven to be a powerful technique for 
reducing damage effects in silicon. Model 
parameterization of damage effects allows the 
calculation of detector performance for long term 
LHC operation.  
• The DOFZ method had been successfully 
transferred to several detector manufacturers. It 
will be used for part of LHC strip and pixel 
detectors.  
• There are still a number of open questions 
regarding the ROSE results. Among them are:  
 
Optimization of the O-enrichment, a possible 
dependence of damage effects on the initial silicon 
material and on the individual process technology.  
• Recent updates of ROSE results have shown that 
the DOFZ process reveals also benefits for neutron 
irradiation. It is argued that these will even be 
larger if tests would extended to higher neutron 
energies, relevant for the LHC tracking area. 
• An absolute first in understanding the diode 
performance on a microscopic level is reported for 
Co-60 gamma irradiated silicon. 
• New studies have shown further improvements for 
the radiation tolerance of silicon by oxygen 
dimerization, dedicated doping with thermal 
donors and by replacing float zone with 
Czochralski grown silicon.   
• Finally it should be mentioned that a new 
international collaboration had been initiated and 
approved by CERN as RD50, which will focus on 
the development of radiation hard semiconductor 
devices for very high luminosity colliders [53].

Abstract 
Capacitance Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (C-DLTS) measurements have been performed on standard and oxygen 
doped silicon detectors manufactured from high resistivity n-type float zone material with <111> and <100> orientation. 
Three different oxygen concentrations were achieved by the so-called DOFZ process (diffusion oxygenated float zone) 
initiated by the CERN-RD48 (ROSE)-collaboration. Before the irradiation a material characterization has been performed. In 
contrast to radiation damage by neutrons or high energy charged hadrons, were the bulk damage is dominated by a mixture of 
clusters and point defects, the bulk damage caused by 60Co-γ-radiation is only due to the introduction of point defects. The 
dominant electrically active defects which have been detected after 60Co-γ-irradiation by C-DLTS are the electron traps VOi, 
CiCs, V2(=/-), V2(-/0) and the hole trap CiOi. The main difference between standard and oxygenated silicon at low dose values 
can be seen in the introduction rate of CiCs compared to CiOi. For highly oxygenated silicon the introduction of CiCs is fully 
suppressed, while the sum of the introduction rates g(CiCs) + g(CiOi) is independent on the oxygen concentration.

1. Introduction  
The CERN RD48 (ROSE) [1,2] collaboration had 
shown that oxygen enrichment of the silicon bulk 
leads to a considerable decrease of damage effects, 
induced primarily by charged hadrons and γirradiation.  But so far it had been shown, that the 
observed changes of the macroscopic properties like 
the change of the effective doping concentration as 
well as the leakage current cannot be fully explained 
by the dominant induced defects, which have been 
investigated by DLTS-, TSC- and other methods    
[3-6]. 
In this work we report on DLTS-studies on 60Coγ- irradiated silicon detectors in order to avoid the 
complications caused by the generation of clusters 
and to search for possible defects, which might be 
responsible for the observed changes in the 
macroscopic properties.  
2 Experimental procedures 
2.1. DLTS 
The measuring method, which has been mainly 
used in this work, is the Capacitance-Deep-LevelTransient-Spectroscopy (C-DLTS), which was at first 
introduced by D.V. Lang [7]. The principle of this 
method is based on the temperature dependence of 
the emission process of trapped charge carriers in 
defect centers in the space charge region of a reverse 
biased diode. For an isolated defect level the 
emission process is an exponential function in time 
with a single emission time constant and is measured 
via the corresponding space charge capacitance 
transient. In our DLTS-system a Fast Fourier 
Transformation is applied to the measured transient 
for data reduction and evaluation of the emission time 
constant and trap concentration [8]. Performing a socalled 
temperature 
scan 
(repetetion 
of 
the 
measurement as function of temperature) the  
determination of virtually all parameters associated 
with traps like activation energy, capture cross 
section, and trap concentration is possible. However 
the application of this method is limited by the 
requirement that the concentration of traps NT has to 
be 
small 
compared 
to 
the 
shallow 
doping 
concentration NS. This limit can be pushed to higher 
trap 
concentrations 
by 
using 
the 
ConstantCapacitance-DLTS (CC-DLTS) technique [9]. Here 
the capacitance of the space charge region is kept 
constant by using a feedback scheme in the bias 
voltage-capacitance measurement system and the 
change of the bias voltage in the feedback loop is the 
DLTS-signal. 
For DLTS peaks, which correspond to defect 
levels with similar activation energies and capture 
cross sections a special deconvolution technique, 
developed by the company PhysTech [10] had been 
used. 
 In general the  CDLTS spectra had been obtained 
with a time window of TW = 200 ms, a filling pulse 
duration of tfill = 100 ms and a reverse bias of UR = 
20 V. 
  
2.2 Material 
The p+nn+ diodes investigated in this work are 
manufactured from high resistivity (ρ=3-4 kΩcm) ntype float zone (FZ) silicon grown in the <111> and 
<100> direction from Wacker. The processing and 
oxygen enrichment has been performed by the 
company CiS [11]. The oxygen doping was achieved 
by diffusion for 24h, 48h and 72h at 1150°C in 
nitrogen. This oxygenated material will be named 
DOFZ while the standard material will be labeled as 
STFZ. A detailed description of the material is given 
in [12].

2.3. Irradiation 
Irradiations had been performed at the high 
intensity 60Co-γ-source of the Brookhaven National 
Laboratory (BNL) in the US at room temperature. 
The samples were irradiated for this investigation in a 
dose range from 0.2 Mrad up to 10 Mrad. 
3. Experimental results 
3.1. Defects before irradiation 
A search for process-induced defects had been 
performed before irradiation. Five different  defect 
levels have been discovered in the material. 
As an example figure 1 shows DLTS spectra for 
electron and hole injection. The properties of these 
defects are listed in table 1, their concentrations are 
listed in table 2. 
 
Table 1 Electric properties of the material defects 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2 Concentration of material defects 
  One of these defects is the so-called thermal double 
donor TD. The introduction of TD's depends strongly 
on the oxygen concentration [13]. As can be seen in 
table 2 the amount of TD's  is correlated with the 
oxygen content of the differently oxygenated devices, 
but the concentrations in the material with <100> 
orientation (CF-CH) are smaller compared to the 
material with <111> orientation. There is no 
measurable amount of thermal donors observed in 
STFZ-material (Wafers CA and CE).  
  The other four defects are so far unknown. The 
electron trap E(120) appears only in oxygenated 
<100> material. This defect has an activation energy 
and capture cross section which are close to the 
values of the double charged state of the divacancy 
V2(=/-) as will be shown later. 
   The defect E(240) is a very deep level and from its 
properties this level is mainly responsible for the 
measured generation current. 
   H(160) is a hole trap. It was just visible in the 
<100> wafer with 24h oxygenation by optical carrier 
injection. 
   H(220) is also a hole trap. It was already seen in 
former material investigations [5]. The concentration 
of this defect is independent of the oxygenation 
concentration and orientation of the wafer, but 
depends on the position of the diode on the wafer, i.e. 
the concentration increases with the distance from the 
center of the wafer to the edge. According to the 
material investigation the <111> material contains 
less defects than the <100> material.

3.2. Radiation induced defects 
The irradiation with a 60Co-γ-source has the 
advantage that only point defects and no clusters are 
generated, while an irradiation with hadrons would 
also cause clusters. In figure 2 a DLTS-spectrum is  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2 CDLTS measurement of electron traps of a <100> STFZ 
detector irradiated with 0.5 Mrad 
shown for a standard detector irradiated with a dose 
of 0.5 Mrad. The small peak at about 60 K is caused 
by the thermal double donor TD already observed 
before irradiation. The dominant peak at 85 K can be 
attributed to the creation of the VOi (vacancy + 
oxygen 
interstitial) 
and 
the 
CiCs(A) 
(carbon 
interstitial + carbon substitutional, state A) defects, 
while the small peaks at 120 K ant 200 K are 
associated with the different charge states of the 
divacancy (V2(=/-) and V2(-/0)). The superposition of 
the VOi and the CiCs signal at 85 K cannot be 
resolved by high resolution techniques, since their 
activation energies and capture cross sections are 
nearly identical. But measurements of the amplitude 
of the DLTS signal as function of the filling pulse 
duration tfill at constant temperature allow to separate 
the signals arising from the CiCs(A) and VOi by 
making use of the bistability of the CiCs defect[4] as 
demonstrated in figure 3 (upper curves). The first 
increase corresponds to the filling of the VOi while 
the second one reflects the configurational change 
from state CiCs(B) to state CiCs(A). For this change 
an activation energy has to be overcome and 
therefore the tfill value at which this step occurs 
depends on the temperature (see curves at T=85 K 
and T= 75 K). The lower curve in figure 3 was  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3 Capture measurement of a standard and oxygenetaed 
detector irradiated with 0.5 Mrad 
measured for an oxygenated sample where such step 
could not be detected. This indicates that in 
oxygenated material the CiCs defect is strongly 
suppressed. For the extraction of the level parameters 
and the concentration of the double charged 
divacancy  V2(=/-) in the <100> material this defect 
had to be separated from the material defect that 
appears at the same temperature in the spectra as 
mentioned before. This was possible by using the 
high resolution DLTS method. As an example figure 
4 shows the measurement of the DLTS signal as 
function of the transient time window (open squares) 
and the separation of both levels by a special 
refolding technique (solid line) [10]. Measurements

Fig.5 Arrhenius plot of the separation levels shown in figure 4 
at different temperatures result in the corresponding 
Arrhenius plot demonstrated in figure 5. Here level 1 
corresponds to the material defect E(120) while level 
2 is attributed to the V2(=/-) level. Figure 6 shows 
spectra for the hole trap CiOi for samples irradiated 
with different doses up to 10 Mrad. As can be seen in  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 6 CDLTS spectrum after hole injection for STFZ samples 
irradiated with different doses 
the spectra the peak shifts slightly for higher doses to 
lower temperatures which is mainly caused by the 
fact that the concentration of this defect exceeds 
already at 4 Mrad the shallow doping concentration 
and thus the DLTS requirement is not fulfilled 
anymore. The activation energies and the capture 
cross sections of all radiation induced trap levels are 
summarized in table 3 and compared with values 
given in [4]. 
The extracted introduction rates for the impurity 
related defects VOi, CiCs and CiOi are presented in 
table 4 for standard and oxygenated devices (72 h) 
manufactured from <111> and <100> material. For 
the creation of VOi no dependence on the oxygen 
concentration is seen while the generation of CiCs  is 
fully suppressed in oxygenated material. This 
suppression is due to the fact that in oxygen rich 
material the probability of the reaction Ci + Oi → 
CiOi is much larger compared to the reaction Ci + Cs 
→ CiCs. But it is expected that the sum of the 
introduction rates g(CiCs)+g(CiOi) stays constant for 
all materials. This holds with the exception observed 
for the standard <100> material (device CE) which 
shows a slightly lower introduction rate. 
 
Table 3: Properties of radiation induced defects 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the other hand the introduction  of 
divacancies V2 is about two orders of magnitude 
smaller compared to the introduction of the impurity 
related defects as can be seen from table  5. A very 
small dependence on the oxygen concentration 
cannot be excluded. Furthermore, it is clear that the 
introduction rate for both charge states should be the 
same. This holds for all extracted values within the

reflects the primary generation of silicon interstitials I 
via the Watkins replacement mechanism I+ Cs → Si+ 
Ci and the subsequent formation of CiCs and CiOi , the 
sum of the introduction rates g(CiCs) + g(CiOi) should 
be equal to the total introduction of Interstitials g(I). 
On the other hand each primary interaction will 
create the same number of vacancies and hence the 
total number of vacancy related defects should 
balance the interstitial related ones. As a consequence 
the following equation for the introduction rates 
should be fulfilled. 
 
 
 
 
This relation holds for <111> material with a ratio 
of 0.91 +/- 0.12 but for <100> material the extracted 
ratio of 0.71 +/- 0.02 is too small. An explanation of 
such a small value can so far not be given. 
All these defects descibed above are well known 
and characterized, but they still cannot explain the 
macroscopic properties like the increase in the 
leakage current and the change in the effective 
doping. In recent studies of our group on these 
devices at larger doses a close to midgap level at EC0.545 eV was observed which can mainly explain the 
radiation induced changes of the macroscopic 
detector properties[14]. 
4. Conclusions 
After irradiation with 
60Co-γ- radiation we 
observed for the different materials the dominant 
introduction of carbon and oxygen related defects and 
a much smaller generation of divacancies. The main 
influence of oxygen in the defect formation is seen in 
the formation of CiCs and CiOi where already oxygen 
enriched material by a diffusion of 24 h shows a full 
suppression of the CiCs defect. In this report no 
difference is seen in material with different 
orientation. For the creation of divacancies the 
introduction rate is about two orders of magnitude 
smaller compared to the creation of impurity related 
defects and a very small dependence on the oxygen 
concentration was observed. A difference between 
<111> and <100> material had only been established 
in the ratio of introduction rates for interstitial related 
defects. All of these defects seen by DLTS in the 
investigated dose range are not responsible for the 
change of the macroscopic device properties. Only a 
recently detected deep level close to midgap can 
explain the macroscopic parameters.

Abstract 
The influence of oxygen in silicon on bulk damage effects induced by 60Co-gamma irradiation has been studied in a dose 
range between 0.2 Mrad to 900 Mrad. The detector processing and oxygen enrichment were carried out in a common project 
by the Institute of Micro-sensors CiS using n-type high resistivity FZ silicon (3-6 kΩcm) with <111> and <100> orientation. 
Different oxygen concentrations were achieved by diffusion at 1150 °C for 24, 48 and 72 hours. This report on bulk damage 
effects is focused on the observed changes in the reverse current, the effective space charge density Neff extracted from C/V 
measurements and investigations using the transient current technique (TCT). A substantial improvement of radiation 
hardness concerning the development of the macroscopic properties was found for detectors manufactured on oxygenated 
material compared to standard material. It will be demonstrated that the change of the effective space charge density as well as 
the increase of the reverse current can be attributed to the creation of two deep acceptor levels and a shallow donor level.

1. Introduction 
It was demonstrated by the CERN RD48 (ROSE) 
collaboration that a considerable improvement in the 
change of the effective space charge concentration 
can be achieved in oxygen enriched silicon for 
charged hadron damage and gamma irradiation while 
after exposure to neutrons no or only little 
suppression was found [1-3]. The beneficial effect of 
oxygen had been discussed and modeled under the 
assumption that most probably the V2O defect is 
responsible for a main part of the radiation induced 
negative space charge and that the formation of V2O 
is suppressed in oxygen rich material [4, 5]. The 
model predictions support also the experimental 
observation that the oxygen effect is correlated with 
the radiation induced formation of point defects. This 
means that in neutron damage the oxygen effect is 
suppressed since the damage is dominated by the 
creation of defect clusters. On the other hand a 
maximal oxygen effect is expected when only point 
defects are created which is the case in 60Co-gamma 
irradiation [2, 6-7]. Here we report on new results of 
bulk damage effects in standard and different oxygen 
enriched high resistivity float zone silicon with 
different orientation (<111> and <100>) for a wide 
dose range up to 900 Mrad. The experimental results 
for the radiation induced change of the effective 
doping concentration and the reverse current will be 
discussed in the frame work of recent microscopic 
studies [8,9]. 
2. Experimental procedure 
The 
oxygen 
enrichment 
and 
the 
detector 
processing was carried out in a common project by 
the Institute for Microsensors CiS (Erfurt, Germany) 
using n-type high resistivity float zone (FZ) silicon 
from Wacker with <111> and <100> orientation. 
Different oxygen concentrations were achieved by 
diffusion at 1150 0C in N2 atmosphere for 24, 48 and 
72 hours. The oxygen depth profiles were measured 
by a special SIMS-technique and compared with IR 
absorption measurements [10]. In Table 1 the 
averaged concentrations of oxygen and carbon are 
listed for all samples under investigation. The p+nn+-
detectors have an active area of 0.25 cm2 surrounded 
by a guard ring with a gap of 10µm between the outer 
edge of the central diode and the inner rim of the 
guard ring. The thickness of the different samples 
varies between 291µm and 295µm. 
The irradiation had been performed at the high 
intensity 60Co-gamma source at the Brookhaven 
National Laboratory (BNL/USA) with a dose rate of 
about 600 krad per hour. The temperature during 
exposure was typically 27 °C. A set of 8 different 
samples was irradiated in consecutive steps of about 
50 Mrad up to 500 Mrad and followed by larger steps 
up to 900 Mrad. Between each step standard I/V and 
C/V 
measurements 
were 
undertaken 
for 
the 
evaluation of the bulk generation current and the 
change of the depletion voltage Vdep needed to fully 
extend the space charge region to the depth d of the 
diode. This voltage is related with the effective space 
charge density q0Neff by: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (1) 
 
where εε0  is the permittivity of silicon, q0 the 
elementary charge and Vbi the build in voltage. Both 
I/V and C/V characteristics were measured at room 
temperature with the guard ring of the device 
properly connected to ground. All presented reverse 
current data are normalized to 20 °C.  
In order to prove the reliability of the extracted 
values for the effective space charge density current 
pulse shape measurements have been performed 
using the transient current technique (TCT) [11,12]. 
For these measurements 6 sets of 8 samples each 
were exposed to fixed dose values.

reverse current (b) for standard (<111>:full circle, <100> full 
triangle) and oxygenated (<111>:open symbols, <100>: crosses) 
devices. 
• 
The detectors manufactured from standard 
material (CA,CE) show the well known effect of 
space charge sign inversion (SCSI). Initially the 
depletion voltage drops to a minimum value at a 
specific dose of about 200 Mrad before it 
increases again with increasing dose. This 
behavior is usually interpreted as a result of the 
creation of deep acceptor like defects and donor 
removal (e.g. formation of E-centers (VPs)) which 
leads to a decrease of the initially positive space 
charge followed by a total compensation at a 
certain dose and thereafter to an inversion of the 
space charge sign. In contrast to this behavior, for 
all oxygenated devices (CB-CD, CF-CH) a small, 
monotonically and non-linear increase in the 
effective space charge density is observed. This 
implies that the effective space charge density 
becomes more positive possibly caused by an 
introduction of donor like defects. 
• 
While the leakage current increase for standard 
material is found to be non-linear, all oxygenated 
detectors show a linear dose dependence. For an 
accumulated dose of 700 Mrad the estimated 
increase is about 3 times smaller compared to that 
of the standard devices. But no differences in the 
reverse current increase could be observed 
between the differently oxygenated sensors 
themselves. 
The findings for the effective space charge density 
and in particular the speculation about the inversion 
had been proven by investigations of current pulse 
shapes recorded for injection of short (≈1 ns) 670 nm 
laser light pulses to the p+- and the n+-contact of the 
diodes. This way time-resolved electron and hole 
transport can be investigated separately. As an 
example Fig. 2a presents current pulse shapes of 
irradiated standard <111> devices for p+-illumination 
and an applied bias voltage of 60 V that was set to be 
well above the full depletion voltages for this set of 
devices irradiated within the dose range of 43 to 284 
Mrad. Since the 670 nm light is absorbed within a 
few microns near to the surface the presented pulse

shapes are dominated by the transport of electrons in 
the electric field zone of the detector. In this case the 
negative slope of the pulse shape for doses up to 190 
Mrad reflects an electric field distribution of a 
positive space charge and the flattening of the slope 
with increasing dose indicates a decrease of the space 
charge density as already demonstrated in the 
development 
of 
Neff 
extracted 
from 
C/V 
measurements. For dose values larger than 200 Mrad 
the slope switches to positive values indicating the 
inversion to a negative space charge. For the same 
dose values and illumination of the p+-electrode Fig. 
2b shows current pulses recorded for an oxygenated 
<100> sensor for a constant bias voltage of 80 V.  
Fig. 2: Current pulse shapes after irradiation with different dose 
values (bottom: 43 Mrad, top: 284 Mrad) for standard <111> 
devices (a) and oxygen enriched <100> devices (b) 
 
For all dose values the changes in slope of the pulses 
in the drift region are very small. The overall change 
of the slope in the range between 43 Mrad and 284 
Mrad corresponds to a variation of the effective space 
charge concentration of ∆Neff = 1.4×1011 cm-3 only. 
4. Discussion 
According to C. B. MacEvoy et al [7] it is assumed 
that the V2O defect, which was first identified in 
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies in 
heavily electron irradiated silicon [13, 14], plays the 
dominant role with respect to both the change of Neff 
and the generation current increase induced by 60Co 
gamma radiation. In his paper it is also demonstrated 
that the model predicts a non-linear increase of V2O 
with dose. If this model is correct we should find a 
correlation between the reverse current increase and 
the 
change 
of 
the 
effective 
space 
charge 
concentration. In Fig. 3 the reverse current of a 
standard <111> detector (CA) is plotted as function 
of the corresponding change of the extracted effective 
space charge concentration defined by ∆Neff = Neff,0 − 
Neff(D). As indicated by the solid line we found an 
excellent correlation in the range below ∆Neff = 
1.3×1012 cm-3 which corresponds with the dose range 
up to 300 Mrad. At higher doses the current increases 
more rapidly than the space charge concentration 
which cannot be explained by an introduction of only 
one deep acceptor like V2O. Therefore, we suspect a 
possible compensation of the negative space charge 
due to the introduction of shallow donors that are 
positively charged in the depletion region.

concentration for a standard <111> diode. 
We will discuss now the experimental findings 
presented in chapter 3 according to recent results of 
detailed microscopic studies on the same material

obtained by C-DLTS- and TSC-measurements [8,9]. 
Two close to midgap acceptor levels were discovered 
which are labeled as DA-I and DA-Γ. The DA-I level 
is most likely the V2O defect while the DA-Γ level 
cannot be attributed so far to a known defect. As 
expected for the V2O the DA-I defect is strongly 
reduced in oxygen rich diodes and the same behavior 
is also observed for the DA-Γ defect. Furthermore, in 
oxygen doped sensors an introduction of shallow 
donors (SD) had been detected in TSC-spectra. This 
defect is most probably the known bistable thermal 
double donor TDD2 [15, 16]. For the calculation of 
Neff and the reverse current Irev as a function of dose 
the defect parameters and introduction rates given in 
[8,9] have been used. 
Fig. 4: Contributions of deep acceptors DA-I and DA-Γ and 
shallow donor SD to the effective space charge Neff  (a) and the 
reverse current (b) for standard material as function of dose. 
Since most of the microscopic studies were 
performed on irradiated samples from <111> 
standard and oxygenated material, we present here 
only calculations for the corresponding detectors 
taken from the same wafer. 
4.1. Standard material 
 In Fig. 4a the effective space charge concentration 
defined by Neff = ND − NA is plotted versus the 
accumulated 
dose. 
Here 
ND 
represents 
the 
concentration of all donors which are positively 
charged in the depleted zone, i.e. the initial 
concentration of phosphorus and radiation induced 
shallow donors, and NA is the concentration of 
charged shallow and deep acceptors. It is obvious that 
both deep acceptors DA-I and DA-Γ are responsible 
for the inversion of the space charge sign. Their 
contributions to Neff as evaluated from DLTS- and 
TSC-measurements are also included in Fig. 4a. As 
can be seen, the dose dependence of the DA-I 
contribution is non-linear while that of the DA-Γ 
defect is linear. Taking only both acceptors into 
account the experimental data should follow a nonlinear development in the total dose range. This is 
obviously not observed, moreover in the high dose 
range the experimental data points favor a linear 
dependence. Such development can only be achieved 
if one includes a small contribution of radiation 
induced shallow donors (SD), and a non-linear 
increase is needed in order to reproduce the 
experimental data. It should be mentioned that from 
TSC- measurements on standard material one can 
only find an indication for the creation of shallow 
donors 
but 
quantitative 
estimations 
of 
their 
concentrations were not possible [9].  
Fig. 4b shows once more the experimental data for 
the reverse current of the standard <111> detector 
where the contributions of both deep acceptors are 
included. Also in this case the different response of 
the DA-I and the DA-Γ defect on the dose is clearly 
seen and the agreement between the measured 
reverse current values and the evaluated values for 
both defects can be stated to be excellent. 
Taking these results into account, the following 
parameterization for the dependence of Neff as 
function of dose D was used: 
 
Neff(D) = Neff,0 + NSD(D) − NA(D) 
(2) 
with Neff,0 = ND,0−NA,0 being the effective doping 
concentration before irradiation. 
For the calculation of NSD we assume that the shallow 
donors are thermal double donors and, therefore, their 
contribution to the space charge has to be counted

twice since they are double positively charged when 
not occupied. Furthermore, the introduction is 
supposed to be non-linear. This leads to the relation: 
 
NSD(D) = gSD×DγSD , 
 
(3) 
and the contribution of both deep acceptors is 
supposed to be: 
 
NA(D) = gDA-I ×DγDA-I + gDA-Γ×D 
(4) 
The g factors denote the effective introduction rates 
for the defects SD, DA-I and DA-Γ which are 
charged in the depleted volume (see also [9]) and the 
γ values describe the non-linearity of the defect 
introduction as function of dose. A possible donor 
removal has been neglected here since the 
phosphorus concentration is very small and from 
defect kinetic simulations a very small removal 
constant is expected [17]. 
The bulk generation current Irev is caused by both 
deep acceptors only and is parameterized by: 
 
Irev/V = αDA-I ×DγDA-I + αDA-Γ ×D 
(5) 
Here V is the volume of the fully depleted detector 
and α describes the current related damage 
coefficients for both deep acceptor levels.  
According to these parameterizations the data 
presented in Fig. 4a and b have been fitted. The 
dotted and broken lines represent the fits to the 
specific contributions of the defects to the effective 
space charge density Neff and the generation current 
Irev respectively. The full lines are the result of a 
fitting procedure which reproduces the experimental 
data for Neff and Irev at the same time. This procedure 
is denoted as "global fit". 
4.2. Oxygen enriched material 
The same fitting procedures were applied to the 
experimental data derived for the oxygenated device 
CD manufactured from <111> material. The results 
are shown in Fig. 5. In this case instead of Neff the 
change of the effective doping concentration defined 
by ∆Neff = Neff (D) − Neff,0 is plotted as function of the 
dose. For this oxygenated material the contribution of 
shallow donors could be estimated from TSCmeasurements making use of the bi-stabitity of this 
defect [9]. It can be clearly seen that the shallow 
donors overcompensate the introduction of the deep 
acceptors DA-I and DA-Γ. On the other hand the 
introduction of both deep acceptors is strongly 
suppressed compared to standard material.  
Fig. 5: Contributions of deep acceptors DA-I and DA-Γ and a 
shallow donor SD to the effective space charge Neff (a) and the 
reverse current (b) for oxygenated material as function of dose. 
As already mentioned before the generation current 
increases linearly with dose (see Fig. 5b) which is 
expected from the observed introduction of both deep 
acceptors in Fig. 5a and the increase is much smaller 
compared to that of standard material. But the 
contribution of both defects to the generation current 
cannot fully reproduce the measured values. As 
pointed out in [9] possible reasons might be an 
underestimation of the concentration for the DA-Γ 
defect and/or a contribution of other deep defect 
centers which possibly could not be detected by TSCmeasurements. 
A further point of interest is the question whether any 
dependence on the oxygen concentration could be 
seen in the macroscopic parameters. From Fig. 1b we

can see that the generation current is obviously not 
influenced by the different oxygen diffusion. This 
implies that already an oxygenation of 24 hours leads 
to the observed suppression in the creation of both 
deep acceptors. But an analysis of the dose 
dependence of ∆Neff for all oxygenated detectors 
processed on <111> material show a very small 
variation of the increase with the oxygen content 
although the fluctuation of the data points is quite 
large. The result is that the introduction of shallow 
donors seems to be influenced by the oxygen 
concentration of the material but it is so far not 
possible to decide whether the introduction rate gSD 
or the exponent γSD is the more sensitive parameter. 
All parameters of the parameterization given by 
eq.(3-5) which had been evaluated from the described 
fitting procedures are summarized in Table 2.  
Further studies of these and other differently 
processed detectors were perfomed for irradiations up 
to ultra-high dose values between 0.9 and 1.76 Grad. 
The results are described separately in [18].

5. Conclusions 
The presented study on bulk damage effects after 
60Co gamma irradiation up to 900 Mrad had 
substantiated the strong influence of oxygen in 
silicon for the development of more radiation tolerant 
detectors. For the first time the observed changes of 
the macroscopic detector properties concerning the 
effective doping concentration as well as the reverse 
current can be explained by radiation induced deep 
acceptors and the creation of shallow donors which 
had been discovered in microscopic studies.

Abstract 
Radiation induced defects in silicon diodes were investigated after exposure to high doses of Co-60 gamma 
irradiation, using Deep Level Transient Fourier Spectroscopy and Thermally Stimulated Current methods. The 
main focus was on differences between standard and oxygen enriched material and the impact of the observed 
defect generation on the diode properties. Two close to mid gap trapping levels and a bi-stable donor level have 
been characterized as function of dose. These defects explain the main macroscopic deterioration effects both in 
standard and oxygen enriched float zone diodes. Radiation damage effects in silicon detectors under severe 
hadron- and γ–irradiation are surveyed, focusing on bulk effects. Both macroscopic detector properties (reverse 
current, depletion voltage and charge collection) as also the underlying microscopic defect generation are 
covered. Basic results are taken from the work done in the CERN-RD48 (ROSE) collaboration updated by results 
of recent work. Preliminary studies on the use of dimerized float zone and Czochralski silicon as detector 
material show possible benefits. An essential progress in the understanding of the radiation induced detector 
deterioration had recently been achieved in gamma irradiation, directly correlating defect analysis data with the 
macroscopic detector performance.

1. Introduction 
High resistivity silicon particle detectors will  be 
used extensively in the tracking areas of the CERN 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. Since for 
this application the detectors are subject to extremely 
high hadron fluences the radiation tolerance of the 
bulk material became of prime importance. In all 
cases high resistivity silicon (ρ > 1 kΩcm) was 
chosen to allow for  low operating voltages. 
A lot of investigations on hadron induced damage 
and the impact on detector performance had been 
extensively studied by the CERN RD48 (ROSE) 
collaboration [1-6]. It had especially been proven that 
the deliberate addition of oxygen ([O]>1017 cm-3) in 
the bulk material is beneficial for the radiation 
tolerance to charged particle and gamma exposure. 
The clearest benefit is gained in the case of 60Co 
gamma irradiation. No change in the initial doping 
concentration was reported up to a dose of 400 Mrad 
for high resistivity Diffusion Oxygenated Float Zone 
(DOFZ) silicon while in the case of Standard Float 
Zone (STFZ) silicon  the type inversion takes place 
around 250 Mrad [2]. Many radiation induced point 
defects (VV=/-, VV-/0, CiCs
-/0, VOi
-/0, CiOi
+/0 etc. ) were 
already well characterized by various methods [5-17]. 
However, 
these 
defects 
cannot 
explain 
the 
irradiation-induced change in the macroscopic 
parameters of the detector performance (doping 
concentration 
and 
leakage 
currents) 
and 
the 
improvement of the radiation tolerance for oxygenenriched silicon. Present defect models attribute the 
beneficial oxygen effect in gamma irradiated DOFZ 
silicon to a lower probability of V2O formation by an 
enhanced production of VO defects [17-20]. The V2O 
defect was identified in Czochralski (CZ) silicon after 
electron 
irradiation 
by 
Electron 
Paramagnetic 
Resonance (EPR) [21] and Photo-EPR measurements 
[20]. An activation enthalpy of (0.50±0.05) eV from 
the conduction band was evaluated for the V2O defect 
in the neutral charge state [22]. Recently, we have 
reported on a deep level located at 0.545 eV from the 
conduction band (Ec) and having electron and hole 
capture cross sections of σn = (1.7±0.2)x10-15 cm2 and 
σp = (9±1)x10-14 cm2  respectively detected in floatzone silicon after Co60-gamma irradiation with doses 
up to 42.5 Mrad [23].  This close to midgap trap (the 
I level in ref.[23]) is strongly generated in STFZ 
diodes but largely suppressed in DOFZ devices and 
was suggested to be related to the V2O complex in 
the single charge state. According to our results it can 
explain about 90% of the change in the effective 
doping concentration (Neff) and 50% of the leakage 
current (LC) in STFZ silicon. Considering that the I 
level was also detected in DOFZ material together 
with the still unexplained difference in the measured 
and calculated leakage current call for further 
investigations, especially after higher doses of 
irradiation. In the following we report on the 
detection 
by 
Deep 
Level 
Transient 
Fourier 
Spectroscopy 
(DLTFS) 
[24] 
and 
Thermally 
Stimulated Current (TSC) [13] methods of other 
trapping levels induced by gamma irradiation, which 
together with the mentioned I level can better explain 
the differences observed between STFZ and DOFZ 
diodes. The devices investigated in this work are 
STFZ and DOFZ p+nn+ diodes processed by CiS [25] 
on Wacker silicon with high resistivity (4 kΩcm) and 
exposed to Co60- gamma irradiation doses of 10 to 
300 Mrad. The average oxygen concentration in the 
DOFZ material is 1.2x1017 cm-3 while in the STFZ 
ones it is less than 3x1016 cm--3 [26]. 
2. Experimental results and discussions 
2.1. DLTFS results 
 The DLTFS method was applied for doses up to 
42.5 Mrad whereas the higher irradiated samples 
were investigated by the TSC method. After 
irradiation all dides were kept at room temperature 
for at least 4 weeks. DLTFS measurements were 
performed on both STFZ and DOFZ samples exposed 
to 10 and 42.5 Mrad irradiation doses. For these high 
doses the DLTFS spectra can be well analyzed only 
for temperatures above 240 K where the most 
abundant irradiation induced point defects (e.g. VO 
and VV) do not contribute anymore to the recorded 
capacitive transients. In addition to the mentioned I 
level (possibly the V2O-/0 complex) another very deep 
level, labeled as Γ, was detected in these samples as 
shown in Fig. 1a. An activation enthalpy of ∆Hv =

0.66eV ±1% with respect to the valence band and an 
effective capture cross-section of σ* = (5±3)x10-15 
cm2 were evaluated for the Γ defect from the 
Arrhenius plot (Fig. 1b). The filling was done using 
forward bias injection and therefore σ* does not 
represent the capture cross section for holes only (σp) 
but includes also the electron capture cross section 
(σn). The σ* is given by the following formula [27]: 
 
 
 (1) 
 
 
 
where vth,p, vth,n are the thermal velocities of holes and 
electrons respectively.  
 
Fig. 1 a) Majority and minority carrier DLTFS spectra recorded on 
STFZ diode after a gamma dose of 42.5 Mrad. A reverse bias of 
RB=-16 V was applied during the measurement.b) Arrhenius plot 
for the Γ level with the evaluation of the activation enthalpy and 
capture cross section. 
The concentration evaluated from DLTFS spectra or 
by direct analysis of transients after forward injection 
does not represent the total concentration of defects 
(NT) but a quantity given by [27]: 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
 
where nT(T) is the steady state occupancy of the Γ 
level, cn,p(T) = σn,p(T)* νth,n,p(T) are the respective 
capture coefficients, NC,V  are the effective densities 
of states in the conduction band. 
Due to its position in the band gap, the Γ level 
might have a strong influence on the detector 
performances – the leakage current per unit volume 
(LC) and the effective doping concentration (Neff). In 
order to estimate it correctly both capture cross 
sections (σn and σp) should be known. Because of the 
high 
concentration 
of 
VV-/0 
states 
a 
direct 
investigation of electron emission from the Γ defect 
is not possible. By direct analysis of transients at 
different temperatures the

 values were 
determined to be 9.60x109cm-3, 9.44x109cm-3 and 
9.36x109cm-3 at 273 K, 293 K and 298 K 
respectively. Assuming that there is no temperature 
dependence of σp and σn between 273 K and 298 K 
then eq. 2 results in σp/σn~100. With such a large 
difference between the two capture cross sections a 
good approximation is σp = σ* = (5±3)x10-15 cm2 as 
was evaluated from the Arrhenius plot in fig.1b. 
2.2. TSC results 
The samples irradiated with higher doses (up to 
284 Mrad) were investigated by the TSC method. 
Also in this case the diodes stayed at room 
temperature for more than 4 weeks prior to the 
measurements. The standard experimental procedure 
consists in cooling down from room temperature 
(RT) to 20 K under 0 bias, followed by forward 
injection (1mA) for 30 sec. and then heating up with 
reverse bias (RB) applied. The heating rate for the 
TSC experiments was always 0.183 K/s.  The  filling

of traps was done either by forward biasing or using 
hole injection by 670 nm LED illumination from the 
rear side of the reverse biased diode. 
In Fig. 2 the recorded TSC spectra for STFZ and 
DOFZ diodes exposed to a dose of 284 Mrad are 
presented. In DOFZ diodes the generation of I and Γ 
defects are strongly suppressed, while the VOi center 
exhibits a larger concentration. This may suggest that 
the VOi center plays a major role in the formation of I 
and Γ defects. In fact, it had been discussed that the 
V2O complex results from the reaction VOi+V ⇒ 
V2O [17-20]. In addition, there are some features 
characteristic only for the STFZ or DOFZ material 
neither reported so far in the literature nor seen in our 
low dose DLTFS measurements [28].

In the STFZ material a strong peak is observed at 
97 K which proved to act as a trapping level for holes 
(see Fig. 3). In the DOFZ case we see a peak at 50 K 
overlapping a very low temperature signal labeled 
“BD tail”. The BD tail disappears after keeping the 
diode in the dark for 2 days at room temperature 
(RT). Instead, the L(42K) and BD(98K) levels appear 
in the TSC spectrum (see Fig. 4). A level with similar 
trapping parameters like L(50K) was already 
investigated by DLTS and IR- Absorption methods in 
oxygen rich Si and was associated with the single 
negative charge state of the interstitial silicon-oxygen 
dimer complex (IO2
-/0) annealing out completely at 
150 0C [15]. Our experiments revealed that both 
L(50K) and L(42K) levels anneal out after 1500 C 
heat treatment (Fig. 5). Instead of these two levels 
another peak labeled L(87K) appears in the spectrum. 
The L(47K) peak is not a result of the annealing. It 
can already be seen  as a shoulder in the L(50K) peak 
prior to annealing. 
It is worth to mention here that no change in the 
magnitude of the leakage current or Neff was 
measured after the annealing at 1500 C. Depending 
on the experimental TSC procedure (cooling after  
exposure to day light or after keeping the sample in 
the dark) a direct correlation between the BD tail and 
BD(98K) level was observed (see Fig. 5). It is well 
known that such bi-stability is characteristic for the 
thermal double donors TDD1 and TDD2 (associated 
with small size oxygen clusters) [29-31]. 
Fig. 6. Change of the activation enthalpy of BD(98K) with 
different reverse bias applied during TSC measurement. 
The donor activity of the BD(98K) level was 
proven observing the Poole Frenkel effect when 
different RB-values were applied during the TSC 
measurements. The change in the activation enthalpy 
was evaluated from Arrhenius plots of the increasing 
part of the peak (see Fig. 6) resulting in a zero field 
activation enthalpy of 0.225 eV for BD(98K) . Thus, 
contrary to the effect of I and Γ the BD centers will 
contribute with positive space charge to Neff. These 
properties of the BD centers (donor activity, bistability, zero field activation energy) together with 
their strong generation in oxygen enriched material 
suggest a possible identification with the thermal 
double donors TDD2. 
3. The impact of I, Γ and BD defects on the 
detector performance 
The following relations were used to calculate the 
contribution of the I, Γ and BD centers to LC (αE) 
and Neff (nT): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         (3) 
 
 
 
where q0 is the free electron charge. 
 
The concentrations of I, Γ and BD centers in STFZ 
and DOFZ for different dose values are given in Tab. 
I. The errors are less than 5% in the case of I level 
and around 20% for the Γ level.  
The experimental values of Neff and LC as 
determined  from C-V and I-V measurements as well 
as the calculated ones are given in Fig. 7. There is a 
very good agreement between measured and 
calculated values of Neff for both STFZ and DOFZ 
diodes. However, the LC cannot be fully described by 
taken only the I and Γ level into account (especially 
in the case of DOFZ). Possible reasons for that can be 
that other deep centers (e.g. VV-/0) have not been 
included.

4. Conclusions 
The DLTFS method applied to gamma irradiated 
STFZ and DOFZ silicon diodes with doses up to 42 
Mrad allowed us to characterize a new close to 
midgap trapping level (Γ center) in addition to the 
already reported I defect (V2O-/0?).The trapping 
parameters of the Γ level are: an activation enthalpy 
of ∆Hv = 0.66eV ±1% from the valence band and a 
capture cross-sections of σp = 100xσn = (5±3)x10-15 
cm2. The dependence of the I and Γ concentrations 
with increasing dose was investigated by the TSC 
method. It was shown that both defects are largely 
suppressed in  DOFZ diodes. In STFZ the I and Γ 
level can almost fully explain the change in both the 
leakage 
current 
 
and 
the 
effective 
doping 
concentration . In the case of DOFZ diodes the 
negative space charge due to I and Γ centers is 
overcompensated by the positive charge introduced 
by some bi-stable donors (TDD2 ?) leading even  to a 
slight increase of the effective donor concentration.
