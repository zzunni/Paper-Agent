ABSTRACT: Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors are 
promising candidate materials for post-silicon electronics. However, it remains challenging 
to attain completely uniform monolayer semiconductor wafers free of over-grown islands. 
Here, we report the observation of the energy funneling effect and ambient 
photodelamination phenomenon in inhomogeneous few-layer WS2 flakes under low 
illumination fluencies down to several nW/μm2 and its potential as a non-invasive postetching strategy for selectively stripping the local excessive overlying islands. 
Photoluminescent tracking on the photoetching traces reveals relatively fast etching rates 
around 0.3−0.8 μm/min at varied temperatures and an activation energy of 1.7 eV. By using 
crystallographic and electronic characterization, we also confirm the non-invasive nature 
of the low-power photodelamination and the highly preserved lattice quality in the asetched monolayer products, featuring a comparable average density of atomic defects 
(~4.2×1013 cm-2) to pristine flakes and a high electron mobility up to 80 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room 
temperature. This approach opens a non-invasive photoetching route for thickness 
uniformity management in 2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic 
applications.

1. Introduction 
The success of modern semiconductor industry benefits vastly from the everincreasing processing and etching capability over semiconductor channels for miniaturized 
device units. As the microelectronics based on bulk silicon approaches its limit, atomically 
thin two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals crystals will be required in near future, owing to 
their ideal dimensionality and self-saturated surface atomic structures.[1–3] Although 
impressive progress has been recently achieved in direct bottom-up synthesis of highly 
oriented 2D semiconductor wafers,[4–7] the yield of purely uniform wafers remains low and, 
in particular, the rate of thickness uniformity over the entire wafers, ~99% in reported 
results, is yet to be improved to meet the stringent requirement for electronic applications. 
In this context, one of the grand challenges for synthesized 2D semiconductor wafers can 
be attributed to suppression of the non-uniform nucleation and removal of the local 
excessive overlying islands. Hence, a highly precise post-etching strategy that enables 
selectively stripping the over-grown overlying layer(s) (i.e., the extra 2nd or/and 3rd top 
layers) from the desired monolayer wafers represents a useful scheme for thickness 
uniformity optimization.  
Top-down thinning schemes with various exciters, including laser,[8–12] plasma,[13–15] and 
oxidants,[16,17] have been proposed, which are proven effective in reducing the thickness of 
van der Waals semiconductors but, in general, suffer from the issue of either lack of etching 
controllability or invasivity to the underlying monolayers to be preserved, because most of 
the schemes involve aggressive physical or chemical reactions that are prone to cause 
unselective over-etching.[8–12] It is well recognized that the electronic performance (e.g., 
charge mobility) of 2D semiconductors is highly sensitive to lattice defects or interfacial 
Coulomb impurities[18,19] and, thus, the traits of high processing controllability and noninvasivity represent vital but challenging prerequisites for thickness uniformity 
management in 2D semiconductors from the point view of practical applications. Very 
recently, we have exploited a realistically non-invasive etching scheme by employing lowtemperature alloying and post-etching.[20] However, the processing convenience of this 
scheme still falls short of expectations. 
In this work, we report the observation of an emerging photodelamination phenomenon 
in few-layer van der Waals semiconductors and its potential as a straightforward atomiclayer etching strategy under low-power light illumination. We find that few-layer WS2 can 
be directly thinned down to monolayers upon excitation down to the level of nW/μm2, 
where the overlying top layers are photooxidized into amorphous aggregates and can be 
simply stripped by rinse. The consequence of thickness reduction after photodelamination 
is jointly verified by multiple spectral methods such as photoluminescence (PL) and Raman 
characterization. The etching rates reach as high as 0.3−0.8 μm/min at varied temperatures, 
featuring an activation energy of 1.7 eV in the photochemical reaction. Importantly, we 
identify the merit of non-invasivity in this less aggressive photodelamination phenomenon 
by coincident crystallographic and electronic characterization. The density of atomic 
vacancies in the as-etched monolayer products is estimated to be as low as ~4.2×1013 cm-2 
and the intrinsic electron mobility reaches up to 80 cm2V-1s-1 at room temperature; both 
values are comparable to the pristine counterparts. This finding represents a non-invasive 
but convenient uniformity management strategy in 2D van der Waals semiconductors for 
high-performance electronics.

2. Results and Discussion 
2.1 Photodelamination phenomenon 
Prior to introducing the intriguing photodelamination phenomenon, we first clarify its 
differences in excitation power and reaction mechanism with the conventional high-power 
laser thinning,[8–12] in spite of their similarity in etching exciters (Figure 1a). The 
conventional laser thinning relies mostly on the effects of instantaneous photoheating and 
thermal sublimation of the local regions of 2D materials, in which the use of high laser 
fluencies is a typical character and the local sample temperature can reach ~1698 K at 90 
mW/μm2 (inset of Figure 1a).[10] By contrast, the variation of sample temperature in 
photodelamination is negligible (e.g., ~0.08 K under 60 nW/μm2), in which low fluencies 
are often adopted and, essentially, the photochemical reaction between the material edges 
and the absorbed aqueous oxygen from ambient surroundings is responsible for the 
controllable oxidation of the overlying layers of WS2 (Figure 1a).[21,22] Hence, the 
photodelamination occurs only from the flake edges (See Movie S1, Supporting 
Information) where the active reaction sites are located due to the presence of dangling 
atomic bonds, while the photothermal thinning can be initiated anywhere in a fashion as 
direct writing.[8–12]  
To present the photodelamination behavior vividly, Figures 1b and 1c show contrastive 
optical images and schematic atomic structures before and after light illumination (λ = 455 
nm, 24˚C, relative humidity ~60%) for a mechanically exfoliated WS2 flake with varied 
local thicknesses: monolayer (1L), bilayer (2L) and bulk. Here the exfoliation medium 
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is directly used as the supporting substrate for 
convenience. In the beginning, the WS2 flake contains mixed pristine 1L and 2L areas 
(Figure 1b). Note that the thickness information can be easily obtained from the brightness 
or photoluminescent (PL) contrast (insets of Figure 1b), because the 1L area (direct 
bandgap) generates much stronger PL emission than the thick areas (indirect bandgap).[23,24] 
After appropriate illumination, the 1L area expands and covers the 2L area, that is, the 
original 2L area is converted into 1L entirely. We term this behavior as photodelamination, 
because the underlying layer in the 2L area is well preserved and only the overlying layer 
is consumed. From the PL image shown in the inset of Figure 1c, one can find that the PL 
intensity of the newly converted 1L area is almost identical to the pristine 1L area on its 
left, indicating the high crystalline quality of the converted 1L area.  
Raman and PL spectra were also used to verify the consequence of the delamination 
behavior by comparing the corresponding spectral characteristics for the 2L area before 
and after photodelamination. Figure 1d shows the contrastive Raman spectra to 
demonstrate the effect of photodelamination, where the intervals between the two A1g and 
E2g Raman peaks are 62.3 and 60.5 cm-1 before and after photodelamination, respectively. 
The change in the interval of Raman peaks is consistent with the effect of thickness 
tailoring from 2L to 1L.[25] Likewise, contrastive PL spectra (Figure 1e) also support the 
consequence of thickness reduction. For the pristine 2L, the PL intensity is negligible as 
compared with the pristine 1L, because of its indirect bandgap.[23,24] However, after 
photodelamination its PL intensity soars dramatically and becomes comparable to the 
pristine 1L, suggesting its conversion to a direct bandgap semiconductor due to the 
reduction in effective thickness[23] without sacrificing the optical properties of the as-

thinned bottom layer. These spectral characteristics strongly corroborate the 
photodelamination in nature, as well as its high etching accuracy down to atomic scale.  
Activation energy responsible for the photodelamination process was also estimated 
through variable temperature experiment. Real-time PL tracking on photoetching traces 
(Movie S1, Supporting Information) reveals relatively fast etching rates around 0.3−0.8 
μm/min at varied temperatures (Figure 1f). According to the classical Arrhenius rule, the 
relation between reaction rate (r) and activation barrier (Ea) can be described as 𝑟∝e−𝐸a
𝑘𝑇, 
where k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Figure 1f shows the 
Arrhenius plot for r versus 1000/T. From the slope we extracted Ea = 1.7 ± 0.4 eV.  
 
2.2 Reaction mechanism  
To look insight into the reaction mechanism, we employed micro-zone elemental 
analysis techniques to characterize the reaction products. Figure 2a shows the micro-zone 
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image for a fully reacted 1L WS2 flake, 
where tiny aggregates with lateral sizes of few nanometers are randomly distributed. The 
circular STEM diffraction patterns (inset of Figure 2a) indicate that the reaction products 
are of fully amorphous state and the pristine lattice crystallinity is completely destroyed. 
Elemental mappings were further used to assess its chemical compositions, which suggests 
the presence of excessive oxygen (O) element, in addition to the tungsten (W) and sulfur 
(S) elements that exist in pristine WS2. Notably, the intensity of the element oxygen is 
much stronger than that of sulfur, indicating that the photodelamination phenomenon is 
essentially a surfacial photooxidation process, in which ambient oxygen is involved 
actively.[21]  
To analyze the valence state of tungsten in the reaction products, X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed on a light illuminated thick flake. Note 
that the reason to use large-area but thick, rather than small and thin, flake is just to fit the 
size (~100 μm) of the x-ray source in XPS. Figure 2b plots the spectrum for the tungsten 
4f core level spanning from 31 to 40 eV, where four characteristic peaks were detected. 
The peaks at 33.0 and 35.2 eV are assigned to the excitations from W4+ atoms, arising 
likely from the underlying unreacted WS2 layers, while the high-lying peaks at 36.2 and 
38.1 eV are assigned to the oxidized W6+ atoms, stemming from the reacted oxysulfide or 
oxides.[26,27] This observation further corroborates the ambient photooxidation mechanism 
behind the photodelamination phenomenon. 
 
2.3 Removal of reaction products  
Next, we explore the feasibility of exploiting the nontrivial photodelamination 
phenomenon as a selective atomic-layer etching strategy, in which the reaction products 
are expected to be readily stripped after etching. For instance, the gaseous reaction products 
are normally pumped out in the conventional reactive ion etching; the solid products are 
evaporated under instantaneously high temperatures in the photothermal thinning.[8–12]  
However, in the photodelamination process, the reaction products develop into unwanted 
solid residues staying on the surfaces, constituting a possible issue for device fabrication.  
To address this issue, we further employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyze 
the adhesive strength of the amorphous reaction products to the underlying preserved WS2

layers. Figure 2c shows the surface morphology for another partially photodelaminated 
flake, where the reaction was intentionally terminated in the middle without consuming all 
the 2L area and thus, the image captures three representative local areas: pristine 1L, 
photoetched/thinned 1L (uneven morphology), and pristine 2L. In the photoetched area, 
randomly distributed aggregates up to a micron scale are seen, which can be attributed to 
the delaminated amorphous reaction products that accumulate due to fluctuations of local 
strain and temperature in the light illumination. We found that these reaction products are 
loosely attached to the photoetched region such that they can be easily stripped by moderate 
rinse in deionized water, because all the delaminated aggregates disappear from the 
photoetched region after rinse, as shown in the contrastive AFM image (Figure 2d). A clean 
surface can be obtained hereafter. 
Apart from the residue stripping, we also checked the etching precision of the 
photodelamination. Figure 2e shows the surface morphology near the etching step for the 
partially photoetched sample after stripping the surfacial reaction residues. A height 
difference of 0.68 nm is recorded, which corresponds to the thickness of a WS2 monolayer, 
verifying the atomic etching precision. Such high etching precision is also proven by the 
cross-sectional STEM image given in Figure 2f. Both results indicate that the 
photodelamination and subsequent rinse enable a clean and precise tailoring of the van der 
Waal semiconductors. 
 
2.4 Energy funneling effect and reaction selectivity 
In addition to the 2L samples, we find that the photodelamination also occurs in the 
thicker samplers with 3L areas, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). We then 
elaborate on the mechanism of reaction selectivity behind the photodelamination 
phenomenon, which can be readily attributed to the presence of ordered band alignment 
and resultant energy funneling effect in the thickness-varied inhomogeneous 
semiconductors due to quantum confinement.[23,28]  Figure 3 shows the schematic diagram 
for an ambiently placed WS2 flake with mixed 1−3L local areas (Figure 3a) and 
corresponding energy levels for the local areas and aqueous oxygen absorbed at the WS2 
surfaces (Figure 3b). In the ambient surroundings filled with humidity and oxygen, the 
etching selectivity originates mainly from two factors: 1) Electron funneling transfer and 
accumulation in thick areas, and 2) Exact locations of the reaction sites. 
It was reported that electrochemical oxidation is the responsible mechanism for the 
degradation of nanoscale semiconductors in ambient surroundings,[21] where the reaction 
occurs between semiconductors and aqueous oxygen absorbed on surfaces. As depicted in 
Figure 3b, incident light illumination can facilitate the reaction by exciting electrons from 
the valence (EV) to conduction band (EC) in semiconductors to promote the generation of 
highly active superoxide ions O2- in aqueous oxygen via charge transfer. However, the 
optically excited electrons in EC tend to drift from the thin to thick areas because of the 
funneling effect for electron transfer along the thickness-varied WS2 areas that feature a 
cascading band alignment. As a result, the excited electrons and generated O2- ions are 
prone to accumulate in the thick areas and lead to high reaction rates therein.  
The high reaction selectivity can be also attributed to the exact positions of reactive 
reaction sites that are usually associated with the local density of dangling bonds or lattice 
vacancies and are located at flake edges. For clarity, we select five typical sites A−E

distributed in different flake areas and compare the chemical reactivity among them. Owing 
to the presence of high densities of dangling bonds at the edges of each layer, the three 
peripheral sites A, C, and D tend to be more chemically active than the central sites B and 
E, resulting in an edge-initiated reaction spreading inwards (Movie S1, Supporting 
Information). In combination of the two factors above, the reaction rates at different sites 
can be categorized as rD > rC >> rA >> rB and rD  >> rE. The variation of chemical reactivity 
at different sites accounts well for the photodelamination behavior, which selectively 
stripes the excessive overlying layers above the desired monolayer base.  
As mentioned, a grand challenge in 2D semiconductor synthesis is the control on the 
non-uniform nucleation and over-grown local islands. A highly selective post-etching 
technique that enables precisely stripping the excessive overlying islands would benefit the 
thickness uniformity management for attaining highly uniform monolayer wafers for 
electronic purpose. Evidently, this photodelamination features a remarkable etching 
selectivity that can be readily exploited for addressing the challenge. In Figure 3c (also 
Figure S2, Supporting Information), we further verify the feasibility of this scheme. With 
appropriate light illumination, the overlying island (i.e., the 2nd layer, shown as a black area 
in the PL image) above the monolayer base can be completely removed. As a result, a wafer 
with uniform thickness distribution over the entire region is attained (See corresponding 
PL images in Figure 3c and Figure S2d, Supporting Information). Also, we confirm the 
applicability of this scheme to MoS2, another van der Waals semiconductor (Figure S3, 
Supporting Information), indicating the universality of this scheme. Hence, it represents a 
possible solution to address the challenge in uniformity management confronted in 2D 
electronics.  
 
2.5 Lattice quality of photoetched 1L WS2 
From the point of view of engineering, the trait of non-invasivity represents a highly 
desired but challenging requirement for atomic-layer etching. We then focus on evaluating 
the etching invasiveness and lattice quality of the photoetched (thinned) 1L WS2. To this 
end, we employed an aberration-corrected, atomically resolved STEM to examine the 
lattice quality of the underlying layer after photoetching by making statistics on the density 
of atomic vacancies over multiple regions.[29]-[31] After transferring a partially photoetched 
and well rinsed flake onto a STEM grid (inset of Figure 4a), we succeeded in locating the 
as-thinned 1L area by identifying the ragged etching boundary, as shown in Figure 4. Note 
that the natural 1L/2L boundaries through mechanical exfoliation tend to be atomically 
sharp at the edges. Selected-area diffraction imaging on the thinned 1L area reveals wellpreserved lattice integrity because only spotted diffraction patterns (Figure 4b) are 
observed without exhibiting any sign of circular patterns as exhibited by amorphous phases 
(e.g., inset of Figure 2a). 
The high lattice quality of the thinned 1L can be also justified through counting the 
density of lattice vacancies. Figure 4c displays typical atomic images for three independent 
areas taken under annular dark-field mode. In such an imaging mode, the heavy atoms 
would exhibit higher brightness than light ones and, accordingly, the presence of atomic 
vacancies can be readily discerned from the reduction in brightness. In this way, the local 
regions containing sulfur vacancies can be clearly visualized and counted for statistical 
analysis. In Figure 4c, the sites of individual sulfur vacancies are all identified and marked

by red arrows. A more detailed method to identify sulfur vacancies can be found in Figure 
S4 (Supporting Information). For statistical purposes, more than 20 independent regions 
with an area of 4 × 4 nm2 were recorded (Figure S5, Supporting Information) for both the 
thinned and pristine 1L areas. For comparison, Figure 4d plots the statistical data on the 
densities of lattice vacancies, [V], for the two types of areas, where the values of average 
(A) and standard deviation (D) from Gaussian fittings were obtained. The average [V] level 
in the thinned 1L area is estimated to be 4.2×1013 cm-2, which is quite comparable to that 
in the pristine 1L area, suggesting insignificant etching invasivity to the preserved layers 
in the mild photodelamination process. 
 
2.6 Electronic performance of thinned 1L WS2 
 It is widely accepted that the electronic performance (e.g. charge mobility, μ) of 2D 
semiconductors assessed through charge transport represents one of the most strict probes 
for material quality, because it is sensitive to both atomic defects and surfacial 
absorbates.[18,19] In addition to atomic defects, we also examine the possible adverse impact 
on the electronic transport of thinned 1L WS2 from surfacial residues due to incomplete 
stripping of reaction products. For this purpose, we prepared field-effect transistors by 
placing the thinned 1L WS2 on a clean BN dielectric and used it as conduction channel. 
Figure 5a shows the cryogenic four-terminal conductivity (G) versus gate voltage (Vg) for 
the transistor. In all measured Ts, the device exhibits high switching ratios spanning 5 
orders in magnitude in response to electric gating, indicating the well-preserved 
semiconducting nature of the thinned 1L flake.  
Figure 5b summarizes the μ values (blue dots) in the entire T regime, where a band-like 
transport behavior is seen, confirming the high lattice quality of the thinned 1L channel. 
Importantly, μ reaches 80 and 210 cm2V-1s-1 at 293 and 10 K, respectively. Both values are 
comparable to those of mechanically exfoliated pristine (red squares) or the state-of-art 
synthesized 1L counterparts,[5,6] further proving the highly preserved lattice quality from 
the parent flakes. More attractively, μ of the thinned 1L WS2 (~0.7 nm) can reach the level 
of 2.5-nm-thick ultrathin Si (silicon on insulator, SOI) FET,[32] revealing the unique 
advantages in surface conditions and thickness over silicon to overcome the challenges of 
the power-law performance degradation and the short-channel effect for More-Moore 
electronics.[1,3]  
The merit of non-invasivity makes photodelamination a superior route over all the 
conventional methods.[8–17] In Figure 5c we compare room-T μ of our thinned samples with 
those defined by other high-power methods.[9,15,20,33] In general, μ of our 1L sample is 1–3 
orders higher in magnitude than the other methods and comparable to the mechanically 
exfoliated WS2 samples[34,35]  or ultrathin silicon.[32,36] Together with the spectral and 
crystallographic characterization, the high electronic performance represents consistent 
evidence that justifies the high crystalline quality in the thinned 1L flakes, which also 
proves the feasibility of exploiting the photodelamination as a non-invasive etching 
strategy for etching van der Waals semiconductors for high-performance electronics.[1–3] 
 
3. Conclusion 
We have observed an intriguing photodelamination phenomenon in van der Waals 
semiconductors and exploited its potential as a feasible atomic-layer etching strategy.

Micro-zone compositional analyses reveal the surfacial photooxidation reaction 
mechanism behind the photodelamination phenomenon. By using extensive spectral (PL 
and Raman), crystallographic (top-view and cross-sectional STEM, XPS and EDS), and 
electronic (μ-T) characterization techniques, we consistently verified the remarkable merits 
of this mild etching strategy, including non-invasivity due to low excitation power, high 
etching selectivity, atomic etching precision, and processing convenience over previous 
methods. The results open a non-invasive atomic-layer etching route for thickness 
uniformity optimization in two-dimensional semiconductors toward high-performance 
atomic electronics. 
 
4. Experimental Section 
Preparation of samples. All WS2 flakes were mechanically exfoliated onto viscoelastic 
PDMS substrates from synthesized crystals with Scotch tapes. The thickness information 
of local WS2 areas was checked by PL and Raman spectra. A 30% hydrogen peroxide H2O2 
solution was employed as a cleaner to remove the chemical groups bonded to the dangling 
bonds at the flake edges to activate the reaction sites. The liquid cleaner was directly 
dropped onto WS2 flakes and the soaking time in oxidant drops was used as an index to 
evaluate the activation efficiency. We also note that the step of H2O2 pretreatment has a 
side effect; it can introduce lattice vacancies at a rate of 8.5×1012 cm-2min-1 (Figure S6d, 
Supporting Information) into the lattice base (e.g., site B in Figure 3a). Long-time H2O2 
pretreatment may lead to unintentional etching of the monolayer base during light 
illumination (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Thus, the duration of H2O2 exposure 
should be minimized to avoid damages to the lattice base.  
Simulation of temperature distribution. To check the photothermal effect and 
investigate the local temperature of the samples under the illumination of a power density 
of 60 nW/μm2, we simulated the steady-state temperature of the WS2 flakes through a 
commercial software. The thermal conductivities are adopted as 116.8 and 0.16 W/(K·m) 
for WS2 and PDMS substrate, respectively. The net optical absorption of 1L WS2 is 
assumed to be 5%. The temperature of the sample rises to 0.08˚C at steady-state. To verify 
the accuracy of this method, we also simulated the temperature under the laser with 90 
mW/μm2, and the results are basically consistent with the previous literature.[10] 
Preparation of cross-sectional STEM sample. The cross-sectional STEM specimens 
were fabricated by a lift-out method using focused ion beam (FIB) technique (FEI Helios 
600i dual-beam system). The partially photodelaminated WS2 flakes containing thinned 1L 
and pristine 2L areas were first transferred on SiO2/Si substrates (Figure S9a, Supporting 
Information). Before FIB milling, amorphous carbon and metal Pt were deposited as 
protection layers onto the WS2/SiO2/Si stacks to avoid chemical contamination during 
milling. Figure S9b (Supporting Information) shows a typical cross-sectional slice for the 
overall quintuple Pt/carbon/WS2/SiO2/Si stacks. A typical atomically resolved crosssectional image is given in Figure S9c (Supporting Information), where an etching step that 
separates the thinned 1L and pristine 2L areas can be clearly seen. 
High-resolution ADF-STEM images were taken on a double aberration-corrected FEI 
Titan Cubed G2 60-300 S/TEM at 60 kV. To enhance the contrast of the sulfur sublattices, 
a medium-range ADF mode was used by adjusting the camera length properly. The probe 
current is set at 56 pA and the integration time is 8 s for collecting an image.

Device fabrication and characterization. The pristine and as-thinned 1L WS2 samples 
were first transferred onto BN/SiO2/Si substrates and etched by mixed O2 and CF4 plasma 
to define the transistor channels. Afterwards, an electron beam lithography system was 
employed to pattern source and drain electrodes, followed by thermal evaporation of 10 
nm Ni/50 nm Au and standard lift-off. The devices were then mounted into the vacuum 
chamber of a probe station (CRX-6.5K, Lake Shore). Electrical measurements were 
performed with Keithley 2636B sourcemeters in a vacuum of 10-5 torr. The field-effect 
mobilities of the devices were calculated by using the equation 𝜇=

Short text for ToC: An intriguing photodelamination phenomenon that arises from 
ordered band alignment and resultant energy funneling effect is observed in nonuniform 
van der Waals semiconductors, which holds potential as a non-invasive but convenient 
atomic-layer etching strategy for thickness uniformity management in 2D van der Waals 
semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.
