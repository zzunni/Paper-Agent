Global quantum networks will beneﬁt from the reliable creation and control of high-performance
solid-state telecom photon-spin interfaces. T radiation damage centres in silicon provide a promising
photon-spin interface due to their narrow O-band optical transition near 1326 nm and long-lived
electron and nuclear spin lifetimes. To date, these defect centres have only been studied as ensembles
in bulk silicon. Here, we demonstrate the reliable creation of high concentration T centre ensembles
in the 220 nm device layer of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers by ion implantation and subsequent
annealing. We then develop a method that uses spin-dependent optical transitions to benchmark the
characteristic optical spectral diﬀusion within these T centre ensembles. Using this new technique,
we show that with minimal optimization to the fabrication process high densities of implanted T
centres localized <∼100 nm from an interface display ∼1 GHz characteristic levels of total spectral
diﬀusion.
INTRODUCTION
Point defect colour centres in solid state systems provide a promising platform for emerging quantum technologies.
A number of colour centres are currently in
development [1, 2], but few of these leading candidates
are both natively integrated into silicon and intrinsically
operate at telecom wavelengths. Radiation damage centres in silicon have recently emerged as promising lightmatter interfaces that simultaneously meet both of these
criteria [3–6]. Within this family of defects, the T centre
notably possesses highly coherent electron and nuclear
spin degrees of freedom and narrow, spin-dependent ensemble optical transitions near 1326 nm in the telecommunications O-band [7]. These properties make the T
centre a competitive candidate for integration into future commercial-scale quantum networks with long-lived
quantum memory and computing capabilities.
Incorporating T centres into such quantum networks
requires a reliable means of making the centres in deviceready material such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI). Other
photon-spin interfaces have been produced by ion implantation and thermal treatment [5, 6, 8–12]. Here, we
use similar techniques to generate high concentrations of
T centres in the 220nm device layer of commercial SOI
wafers. We achieve T centre concentrations > 30 times
higher than in previously measured bulk samples and,
in follow-on work [13], present evidence that these SOI
concentrations are > 1.7×1013 cm−3. Moreover, the inhomogeneous broadening of the zero phonon line (ZPL)
within implanted ensembles is only ∼35% larger than
in T centre ensembles generated by electron irradiating
and annealing comparable bulk material.
The fabrication process used to generate T centres
should preserve the excellent spin and optical properties
that T centre ensembles exhibit in bulk silicon where the
majority of centres are located far from material interfaces. The increase in electric and magnetic ﬁeld noise
near those interfaces can dramatically degrade a centre’s
spin and optical properties. Encouragingly, donor spin
defects in silicon have already demonstrated competitive electron and nuclear spin coherence times (> 0.5 s,
> 30 s) at distances of just 10 nm from 28Si/SiO2 interfaces [14], and T centres can be expected to demonstrate comparable or better spin properties at our target
depth of 110 nm.
In the optical domain, spectral diffusion — the time-varying changes in a centre’s optical
transition energies — often dominates the optical properties of emitters located near interfaces. Spectral diﬀusion
can reduce the indistinguishability of emitted photons,
limiting an emitter’s potential in quantum technologies.
Measuring the characteristic spectral diﬀusion of the generated T centre ensembles thus provides an important
metric for benchmarking our fabrication process. To this
end, we develop a method that uses spin-dependent optical transitions to eﬃciently measure the characteristic
long-term (total) spectral diﬀusion within an ensemble of
emitters.
Applying this new technique to our high-concentration
T centre ensembles in SOI, we measure characteristic total spectral diﬀusion of ∼1 GHz. Although this value
is ∼104 times larger than the 169 kHz lifetime-limited
linewidth, excellent photon indistinguishability could still
be achieved by employing fabrication or measurement
techniques designed to stabilize the electromagnetic environment [15–18], by ﬁltering the emitted photons [19, 20],
or by Purcell-enhancing the radiative decay rate [21, 22]
as the T centre is expected to have a high radiative eﬃciency [7].

T CENTRE IMPLANTATION
As shown in Fig. 1a, the T centre is thought to consist
of two carbon atoms sharing the substitutional site of one
silicon atom; an interstitial hydrogen terminates one of
these carbon atoms while the other remains stable with
an unpaired electron [23]. The current formation model
for this defect consists of an interstitial carbon capturing
a hydrogen atom and then migrating to a substitutional
carbon site during heat treatment at temperatures between 350◦and 600◦C [7, 23]. Starting from SOI with a
220 nm thick Czochralski (CZ) natural Si (natSi) device
layer and 3 µm of buried SiO2, we realize this formation process by implanting carbon and then hydrogen in
a ﬁxed [C:H]=1:1 dose ratio, annealing between the two
implants and then again after the hydrogen implant.
We performed two fabrication runs: one with a 12C implant and doses of 7 × 1012 cm−2 and a second with 13C
and doses of 7×1013 cm−2. These doses, which were chosen from measurements detailed in the Supplementary
Materials (SM) [24], place the initial carbon concentrations well above the carbon solubility limit for silicon at
1000◦C [25]. Carbon implants were performed at an energy of 38 keV, while hydrogen was implanted at 9 keV
to target overlapping implantation proﬁles with a mean
depth of 110 nm.
In between the two implants, we perform a rapid thermal anneal at 1000◦C for 20 seconds in an argon background to repair lattice damage generated during the
carbon implant and to incorporate carbon onto substitutional lattice sites [5, 26]. The subsequent hydrogen implant then generates lattice damage and interstitial carbon to promote T centre formation, but the smaller mass
of the hydrogen ions generates less total damage than the
carbon implant [24]. After the hydrogen implant, we boil
the samples for 1 hour in deionized water to further increase the hydrogen concentration before performing a
ﬁnal rapid thermal anneal for 3 min at a temperature
ranging from 345◦to 480◦C in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Fig. 1b shows the integrated area of the T centre ZPL
as a function of the ﬁnal anneal temperature for a series of SOI samples. For these samples, we ﬁnd optimum
temperatures of 400◦C for a ﬂuence of 7×1012 cm−2 and
420◦C for 7 × 1013 cm−2.
Unless otherwise noted, we
have normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra to the
free exciton (FE) recombination line at ∼1097 meV. Although the FE recombination line can vary in intensity
across samples as, for instance, the density of recombination sites changes, it provides a means of roughly quantifying the T centre concentration to enable comparison
amongst samples.
In Fig. 1c,d, we plot the PL spectra under above-band
(532 nm) excitation for these particular SOI samples
alongside that of an isotopically-puriﬁed 28Si bulk sample with an initial 1.5×1015 cm−3 carbon concentration.

The signal has been normalized to the ﬁtted T centre ZPL

T centres were created in this bulk sample by electron irradiating and annealing (details in Ref. [7]). Fig. 1d provides a detailed view of the T centre sideband spectra,
showing an isotopic shift in the local vibrational modes
(LVMs) as the 7 × 1013 cm−2 SOI sample was implanted
with 13C isotopes, the 7 × 1012 cm−2 SOI sample was
implanted with 12C, and the bulk 28Si sample contains
a natural distribution of carbon isotopes (98.9% 12C). In
Fig. 1d, we have also labeled both ZPLs within the T
centre exciton doublet, where TX1 sits 1.76 meV above
TX0 [7].
By normalizing the integrated area of the T centre
ZPL to the nominal sample thickness, we estimate that
the implanted T centre densities for the 7 × 1012 cm−2
and 7 × 1013 cm−2 SOI samples are > 5 and > 30 times
larger than the T centre density in the bulk 28Si sample, respectively. Here, we have used 220 nm as the SOI
thickness and the 2.5 µm absorption depth of 532 nm
light in silicon at cryogenic temperatures [27, 28] as the
nominal 28Si thickness. As the free excitons generated by
the 532 nm excitation are not conﬁned to the absorption
region in our bulk sample, this latter thickness serves as
a lower bound, making our relative concentration estimates lower bounds on the true ratios. In the SM, we
verify that the implanted T centres are localized to the
SOI device layer by selectively etching away the device
layer and also by using ultraviolet PL excitation, which

===== Page 3 =====

has a much shallower absorption depth than 532 nm [24].
We also note that this estimate of the T centre density
neglects diﬀerences in the defects’ local optical environment that could modify their emission properties [29].
In Fig. 1e, we compare the ZPL PL for T centres
generated by implantation to that of T centres created
by electron irradiation. Both samples in this ﬁgure are
bulk, ﬂoat-zone (FZ) natSi.
One was implanted with
13C and hydrogen at a ﬂuence of 7 × 1012 cm−2, while
the other was electron irradiated and annealed to convert native carbon and hydrogen into T centres [7]. We
once again see the expected 13C isotopic shift in the implanted ZPL, and at 4.2 K, we report ZPL linewidths
of 6.67 ± 0.09 GHz in the irradiated FZ sample and
9.01 ± 0.08 GHz for the implanted FZ wafer. As will be
shown below, these linewidths lie well above the linewidth
of our 28Si sample and below that of our CZ SOI samples.
Among these measurements, however, this comparison
between FZ natSi samples provides the best comparison
between implanted and irradiated linewidths as each used
similar material outside the “semiconductor vacuum” of
28Si [30]. We thus report only a ∼35% increase in the
inhomogeneous broadening for our implanted ensembles
compared to ensembles generated by electron irradiation,
and we expect that the broader lines we observe in CZ
SOI will be reduced for T centres created by implantation into a FZ SOI device layer.
HYPERPOLARIZATION
In other solid state emitters that lack inversion symmetry, spectral diﬀusion has been shown to increase when
centres are generated by ion implantation [18, 31] or as
centres approach interfaces due to a dramatic increase
in electric and magnetic ﬁeld noise in these regions [32–
34]. Typically, spectral diﬀusion is measured by tracking
spectral lines of individual emitters. Here, we develop
a novel technique for measuring spectral diﬀusion within
an ensemble of emitters and use it to compare the optical
properties of the T centres in our SOI samples to those
in bulk samples.
Under spin-selective resonant optical driving, the T
centre ground state electron spin will hyperpolarize
through a process shown schematically in Fig. 2a. This
unpaired electron provides a spin degree of freedom with
an isotropic g-factor of ge = 2.005 in the orbital ground
state.
Upon resonant generation of a bound exciton
(BE), the ground state electron pairs with the BE electron to form a spin-0 singlet. The BE hole then provides
an unpaired spin with an anisotropic g-factor gh in the
BE TX0 state.
A magnetic ﬁeld Bz thus generates a
spin splitting geµBBz (ghµBBz) in the ground (excited,
or TX0) state where µB is the Bohr magneton. Because
these splittings can diﬀer in magnitude, for Zeeman splittings εB(Bz) = (±ge ±gh)µBBz larger than the homogeneous optical linewidth, only one spin sublevel will be excited by the resonant optical drive. Spin non-conserving
relaxation will then shelve the system in whichever state
is not addressed by the optical drive, hyperpolarizing the
electron spin as the T centre is optically cycled. For the T
centre, this hyperpolarization mechanism is eﬃcient [7].

and the green arrows show ﬂuorescent relaxation pathways.
(e) Schematic depiction of the loss in PLE signal as a magnetic ﬁeld splits the T centre spin sublevels. The resulting
PL spectrum (green curve) is described by Eq. 1.
Using this process, we can reveal the characteristic homogeneous optical linewidth of an ensemble by measuring how the resonantly-driven ZPL evolves in a magnetic
ﬁeld.
In the absence of any homogeneous broadening
eﬀects, an individual T centre’s optical linewidth will
approach its lifetime-limited lower bound and observable hyperpolarization at low magnetic ﬁelds is expected.
This onset of hyperpolarization only weakly depends on
the inhomogeneously-broadened ensemble lineshape and
will apply to ensembles in 28Si and natSi alike. Homogeneous eﬀects such as thermal broadening or spectral diffusion will delay this onset of hyperpolarization to larger
magnetic ﬁelds as shown schematically in Fig. 2b. If these
homogeneous mechanisms have a characteristic broadening on the same scale as the spin splitting, they will ensure that each spin sublevel is intermittently addressed
by the optical ﬁeld, reducing the level of hyperpolariza-

tion in the system and increasing the measured PL.
In Fig. 2c, we perform PLE spectroscopy of the T
centre ZPL in the bulk 28Si sample by scanning a tunable laser over the optical resonance and measuring the
PL emission within the collection window highlighted
in Fig. 1d. Repeating this measurement as a function
of Bz, we see that, rather than Zeeman splitting along
the dashed lines of Fig. 2c, the PLE trace remains stationary and slowly decays as the interrogated T centres hyperpolarize.
This measurement was performed
at a temperature of 4.2 K where the ZPL linewidth is
thermally-broadened [7] and with Bz aligned along the
⟨100⟩crystal axis. For this ﬁeld orientation, we expect
the hole g-factors for the twelve possible T centre orientational subsets relative to B⟨100⟩to take on the values
gh = {0.91, 2.55} with multiplicities of 4 and 8, respectively [24, 35].
The measured hyperpolarization dynamics can be
modeled by noting that both spin sublevels must be
driven to prevent population shelving. With a magnetic
ﬁeld applied, the spin sublevels split by εB(Bz) where
each sublevel is assumed to have the same optical homogeneous linewidth Γ. As the spin states separate and
the probability of driving both sublevels decreases, the
system starts to hyperpolarize. Assuming weak optical
driving, we model this process with a rate model using
the levels and transitions shown schematically in Fig. 2d
and ﬁnd that the amplitude of a partially hyperpolarized
PLE spectrum (Fig. 2e) is proportional to
A(Bz, ∆) ∝
LB(Bz, ∆)LC(Bz, ∆)
LB(Bz, ∆) + LC(Bz, ∆)
(1)
where LB(C)(Bz, ∆) is the Lorentzian amplitude of the
spin-down (spin-up) sublevel and ∆is the optical detuning from the zero-ﬁeld resonance. For simplicity, we have
neglected optical transitions between states with diﬀerent spin orientations, which have smaller spectral overlap
with other transitions and have been shown for T centres to be much weaker than optical transitions between
spin states of the same orientation [7]. The eﬀect of these
transitions is examined in the SM [24].
Evaluating Eq. 1 and normalizing to the Bz = 0, ∆= 0
value, we obtain an expression for the PLE amplitude as
a function of magnetic ﬁeld for a single T centre:
Ah(Bz, ∆) =
Γ2
4∆2 + Γ2 + εB(Bz)2 .
(2)
Because we simultaneously interrogate a large number
of T centres in twelve possible orientational subsets, we
model our measurement by averaging Eq. 2 across the
twelve values of gh. Here, we have assumed that each
orientation contributes equally to the measured signal.
Fitting the data in Fig. 2c to this model, we extract a
homogeneous linewidth of Γ = 250 ± 100 MHz, which
agrees very well with the purely thermal linewidth of
230 MHz at 4.2 K calculated from the thermal broadening data in Ref. [7] as well as the ΛPLE =
329.8 ±
0.6 MHz linewidth obtained by ﬁtting the PLE spectrum
in the B⟨100⟩= 36 G residual magnetic ﬁeld of our setup.
These ﬁts are shown in the insets to Fig. 2c, and the
SM provides additional plots demonstrating good agreement between the modeled and measured data [24]. The
large uncertainty in Γ is dominated by uncertainties in
sample alignment and g-factor calculations as detailed
in the SM [24]. Simultaneous magnetic resonance measurements in a magnetic ﬁeld could address these sources
of uncertainty by providing in situ calibration of the gfactors for an arbitrary sample orientation.
SPECTRAL DIFFUSION IN BULK SI
When cooled to 1.4 K, the thermal broadening contribution to the ZPL linewidth is 33 kHz, and the
ZPL PLE linewidth in the
28Si sample narrows to
ΛPLE = 38 ± 6 MHz [24].
In the absence of signiﬁcant
thermal broadening, we may assume that measuring
Γ amounts to measuring the total spectral diﬀusion
linewidth Γsd.
To measure Γsd at 1.4 K, we resonantly drive the T centre ZPL and ramp B⟨100⟩. Fitting the normalized data shown in Fig. 3a to Eq. 2
averaged over the twelve orientational subsets, we ﬁnd
Γsd = 27±12 MHz for our bulk 28Si sample which agrees
with the measured ΛPLE. We stress this model only considers homogeneous broadening and ignores any inhomogeneities that might be present. For our measurements
of Γsd, we integrate PL counts for ≥1 s at each value
of B⟨100⟩, making this a long-term average value of the
characteristic spectral diﬀusion within the T centre ensemble.
To demonstrate that this method can provide a means
of measuring ensemble homogeneous linewidths that are
not resolved in an inhomogeneously broadened PLE spectrum, we repeat this measurement on T centres in our
bulk FZ natSi sample, which has an inhomogeneouslybroadened optical linewidth of ΛPLE = 6.0 ± 0.2 GHz at
1.4 K. To include this inhomogeneous broadening in our
hyperpolarization model, we replace ∆→∆+ δE in
Eq. 2 to account for inhomogeneously-shifted resonances
and convolve the result with a distribution of δE described by a Gauss-Lorentz product with a full width at
half maximum equal to the measured optical linewidth
ΛPLE.
For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to ∆= 0,
and once again, we model contributions from diﬀerent T
centre orientational subsets by averaging the calculated
response over the expected distribution of gh.
Because our single crystal natSi sample has been cut
along an unknown crystallographic axis, we can only extract an upper bound on Γsd by ﬁtting the measured data
shown in Fig. 3b as a function of magnetic ﬁeld alignment
and selecting the orientation that maximizes Γsd as de-

Eq. 2. The model curves in (b) assume dynamics dictated

tailed in the SM [24]. From this maximal orientation, we
ﬁnd Γsd ≤16 ± 7 MHz (the orange curve in Fig. 3b).
For comparison, we then assume the measured decay is
entirely dictated by inhomogeneous broadening and plot
the behaviour predicted by Eq. 2 with Γ equal to the inhomogeneous linewidth ΛPLE = 6.0 GHz. The resulting
model curve (shown in green in Fig. 3b) fails to match the
data. As these models are calculated for bounding cases,
we can comfortably conclude that this method extracts
linewidths narrower than ΛPLE.
SPECTRAL DIFFUSION IN SOI
Lastly, we use this method to benchmark the optical properties of implanted T centres in CZ SOI.
At 1.4 K, the SOI samples shown in Fig. 1d display
inhomogeneously-broadened

linewidths
of
ΛPLE = 20.6 ± 0.3 GHz and 22.8 ± 0.5 GHz for the
samples implanted with ﬂuences of 7 × 1012 cm−2 and
7 × 1013 cm−2, respectively. We measure the PLE amplitude as a function of B⟨100⟩over the range of B⟨100⟩
for which our optical setup remains stable, and we ﬁnd
Γsd = 1.0 ± 0.2 GHz and 1.3 ± 0.3 GHz, respectively.
Notably, the sample that received the lower implant ﬂuence shows a slightly reduced level of spectral diﬀusion.
This suggests that at least some portion of Γsd could be
attributable to our fabrication process and might be improved with additional surface treatment [17], reduced
implant ﬂuence [31, 36], or further processing.
It is important to note that the assumption of equally
weighted contributions from each T centre orientation
is likely not true.
To address this, we have also ﬁt
our data under the assumption that the measured signal
comes entirely from the T centre orientation that minimizes (maximizes) Γsd to obtain the bounding sets Γsd ∈

for the 7 × 1012 cm−2 and 7 × 1013 cm−2 samples, respectively. Once again, simultaneous magnetic resonance
measurements in a magnetic ﬁeld could improve the precision of this technique by calibrating the relative signal
contributions of diﬀerent orientations.
Even with this uncertainty, however, this method provides eﬃcient comparative measurements of Γsd and
rapid feedback on fabrication processes designed to reduce Γsd. Measuring PLE decay due to spin-dependent
optical transitions can provide the characteristic Γsd
within an ensemble of emitters when complementary
techniques such as spectral hole burning [37] are not possible. Moreover, because our measurements interrogate a
large ensemble of T centres simultaneously, the technique
developed here enables quick access to the characteristic
value of Γsd across a sample, which can be time consuming to obtain by measuring individual centres.
OUTLOOK
Although far from the lifetime-limited linewidth of
Γ1 = 169 kHz [7] and ∼100 times larger than the values
we report in bulk samples, these values for Γsd of implanted T centres in CZ SOI are already competitive with
other solid state emitters near interfaces. It is common
for spectral diﬀusion in defect centres that lack inversion
symmetry to be on the order of several GHz in the absence of careful surface treatment or experimental protocols [16, 31–34]. With minimal optimization, implanted
T centres display ∼1 GHz characteristic spectral diﬀusion, and this could be minimized further as fabrication
and measurement techniques continue to develop. Moreover, the characteristic spectral diﬀusion reported here is
a long-term, ensemble average. Individual centres within
this ensemble could have much lower Γsd [9, 18], and any
slowly varying eﬀects that contribute to this long-term

===== Page 6 =====

average might be addressed by feedback or ﬁltering techniques [19, 20].
To estimate the eﬀect spectral diﬀusion will have on
the performance of a T centre-based photon-spin interface, we calculate the indistinguishability of two photons
emitted by a given T centre as I = ξΓ1/(ξΓ1+Γsd) where
ξ = 0.23 is the T centre Debye-Waller factor [7, 21, 38].
For our bulk and SOI samples, respectively, we ﬁnd
I ∼2 × 10−3 and I ∼4 × 10−5. We stress that both
of these values can likely be improved by employing fabrication or measurement techniques designed to stabilize
the electromagnetic environment [15–18] or by ﬁltering
the emitted photons [19, 20]. Moreover, embedding T
centres inside optical resonators can Purcell enhance Γ1
to increase the photon indistinguishabilty. Optical resonators in SOI capable of demonstrating Purcell factors
above 104 have already been demonstrated [39]. Because
the T centre radiative eﬃciency is expected to be nearunity [7], T centres incorporated into such an optical
cavity could provide high quality photon-spin interfaces
in the telecommunications O-band.
In summary, we have demonstrated a reliable method
for using ion implantation and annealing treatments to
incorporate T centres into industry-standard silicon integrated photonics material. We then developed an efﬁcient method, which could be applied to a wide variety of colour centres, for using spin-dependent optical
transitions to benchmark spectral diﬀusion. Finally, we
used this new technique to show that implanted T centres within a 220 nm SOI device layer can display GHzscale levels of spectral diﬀusion with minimal optimization. These results represent an important step towards
developing quantum technologies in silicon.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Measurement Details
The samples are mounted in a liquid helium cryostat.
The sample temperature is set by pumping on the liquid helium bath. The PL and PLE spectroscopy measurements were performed as reported in Ref. [7]. For
PLE spectroscopy measurements a Toptica DL100 tunable diode laser was used for measurements of 28Si, and
a tunable nanoplus DFB laser diode was used for the
broader SOI and bulk natSi samples.
Implantation Dose Optimization
To select an implant dose for our T centre implantation study, we ﬁrst generated T centres in ﬂoat zone (FZ)
silicon wafers by co-implanting carbon and hydrogen. We
swept the ﬂuence of the implants while keeping ﬁxed C:H
ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 1:0. Carbon implants were again
performed at an energy of 38 keV, and hydrogen was implanted at 9 keV. The samples were then annealed in air
following a (100, 300, 350, 400, 450)◦C step-wise temperature proﬁle with dwell times of (60, 30, 30, 60, 60) min.
This temperature proﬁle was chosen as it previously generated high density T centre concentrations in electronirradiated, high-carbon bulk samples.
Fig. 5a shows the integrated area of the FE-normalized
T centre ZPL for each ﬂuence we measured, and Fig. 5b
presents the PL spectra for the implant ﬂuences that generated the brightest T centre ZPL for each C:H ratio.
Each spectrum shows a strong T centre ZPL, but the 1:0
C:H sample has a much higher broadband radiation damage background. By comparison, the 1:1 and 2:1 C:H implants show comparable T centre intensity with a much
lower background for carbon ﬂuences of 7 × 1012 cm−2.
From this data, we decided to ﬁx the C:H ratio at 1:1 and
implant at ﬂuences of 7 × 1012 cm−2 and 7 × 1013 cm−2.

T Centre Localization
To conﬁrm the generated T centres are localized within
the SOI device layer, we etched away the device layer
from one of our SOI samples and measured PL from
the exposed buried oxide and handle wafer material. As

shown in Fig. 6a, the resulting 532 nm PL spectrum
shows no signiﬁcant T centre PL as compared to the
same sample in an unetched region, suggesting that the
handle material does not contain a signiﬁcant concentration of T centres.

spectra of an implanted sample that has had a portion of its
device layer etched away. (b) PL spectra of implanted SOI
samples under 532 nm and UV excitation.
As further conﬁrmation that the generated T centres
are localized within the SOI device layer, we performed
PL spectroscopy with UV excitation. Because the absorption depth of 532 nm light in Si is 2.5 µm at cryogenic
temperatures, the SOI PL spectra presented in the main
text sample both the SOI device layer and the silicon
handle wafer beneath the buried oxide. UV wavelengths
have a penetration depth of < 1 µm in Si at cryogenic
temperatures [27, 28], making PL with UV excitation
more sensitive to the device layer than PL with 532 nm
excitation. Fig. 6b shows a representative PL spectrum
measured on the same sample with both 532 nm excitation and UV excitation. Because the UV measurement
shows a negligible FE recombination line, we have normalized both spectra to their integrated signal.
Both
spectra show strong T centre lines, conﬁrming that there
are T centres within the device layer.
Taken together, these two measurements localize our
implanted T centres to within the device layer of the SOI
materal.
Calculating g-factors
Our calculation of the hole g-factors expands upon the
work of Ref. [35]. We write the hole Hamiltonian as the
sum of a strain and a magnetic term Hh = Hs(ϵ)+Hb(B)
where the strain Hamiltonian is
Hs(ϵ) = −b
X
i
(J2
i −I)ϵii −d
√

i̸=j
[Ji, Jj]ϵij.
(3)
Here, Ji are the angular momentum operators, [Ji, Jj] =
1
2(JiJj +JjJi), ϵij are strain tensor components, and b, d
are deformation parameters. An external magnetic ﬁeld
⃗B enters the Hamiltonian as
Hb( ⃗B) = µB

X
i
BiJi + g2
X

.
(4)
where µB is the Bohr magneton and g1, g2 are the hole
g-factors.
We use the internal strain and deformation parameters obtained by Ref. [35]: ϵY Y = −0.65 × 10−3, ϵZZ =
−0.26 × 10−3, b = −0.8 eV, and d = −2.7 eV. The internal strain parameters were deﬁned relative to the defect
axes where ˆy is parallel to ⟨110⟩and ˆz is in the (110)
plane, tilted from the ⟨001⟩axis by 4◦. In our treatment,
we rotate the internal strain from the defect coordinate
system to that of the crystal so that magnetic ﬁeld alignments can be referenced to crystallographic axes.
Rather than using the g1 = 1.3 and g2 = −0.1 values
from Ref. [35], we obtain g1 = 1.505 ± 0.022 and g2 =
−0.138±0.012 by ﬁtting the model above to the g-factors
obtained in Ref. [7], restricting ourselves to gi values near
those reported in Ref. [35]. The highly-resolved 28Si data
from Ref. [7] enables us to ﬁt the hole g-factors using all
twelve T centre orientational subsets.
For this ﬁt, we
also introduce a misalignment of the magnetic ﬁeld as
an additional free parameter. Our ﬁt returns an angular
inclination of 10.1◦± 0.1◦and rotation of 71.9◦± 0.6◦
about the nominal ⟨110⟩ﬁeld alignment in that work.
Table I provides comparisons between our ﬁt results and
the gh values reported in Ref. [7] for a ⟨110⟩magnetic
ﬁeld alignment.

TABLE I: Comparing hole g-factors for a ⟨110⟩magnetic ﬁeld

With model parameters in hand, we then calculate gh
for each T centre orientational subset by ﬁnding the Bi
components for each subset, computing the eigenvalues of
Hh, and dividing the resulting spin splitting by µBB. Hh
predicts a negligible zero-ﬁeld splitting within the TX0
orbital branch and negligible interaction with the TX1

justifying this approach for calculating the gh values.
The g-factors for ⃗B ∥⟨100⟩used in the main text are
listed with their calculated error bars in Table I. For these
calculations, we have assigned inclination and azimuthal
⃗B-ﬁeld alignment errors of ±10◦each.

For our bounding calculation of Γsd in natSi, we ﬁt the
measured data as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld alignment. The ﬁtted values for Γsd are plotted as a function
of the magnetic ﬁeld orientation in Fig. 7. Here, we have
omitted magnetic ﬁeld orientations for which the model
is unable to ﬁt the measured data. The model curve in
Fig. 3b of the main text is plotted using inclination and
azimuthal angles of 0.30π and 0.25π, respectively.
Optical Transitions Between Diﬀerent Spin
Orientations
In the model presented in the main text, we have neglected optical transitions between diﬀerent spin orientations. Including these transitions into the rate model
used to derive Eq. 1 of the main text, we can rewrite the
amplitude proportionality as
A ∝LBLC + LALC + LBLD + LALD
LA + LB + LC + LD
(5)
where the optical transitions are labeled by subscripts as
in Fig. 8a. The amplitudes LB, LC have been measured
to be ∼10 times larger than LA, LD [7, 13]. Moveover,
since

 ∂LD
∂Bz
 >
 ∂LB
∂Bz
 ,
 ∂LC
∂Bz
, the approximation
given by Eq. 1 of the main text becomes better as Bz
increases.
To quantify the eﬀect of the LA and LD optical
transitions on our hyperpolarization model, we ﬁt the
thermally-broadened T = 4.2 K data displayed in Fig. 2c
of the main text using the four-transition model of Eq. 5.
Ignoring inhomogeneous broadening, we ﬁnd Γ = 250 ±
100 MHz with LA,D = 0 and Γ = 260 ± 100 MHz
with LA,D = 0.1LB,C. To further explore this dependency, we ﬁx LA,D + LB,C = 1, ﬁt the measured data
as a function of LA,D, and compare the homogeneous
linewidth extracted from the model to the optically measured linewidth ΛPLE = 329.8 ± 0.6 MHz. Plotting the
results in Fig. 8b, we see that Γ only becomes strongly
dependent on LA,D when LA,D > LB,C, as expected. In
this regime, the hyperpolarization model returns values
of Γ that are much larger than the optically-measured
value, supporting the assertion that LA,D ≪LB,C that
has been experimentally veriﬁed elsewhere [7, 13].

Good agreement between the optical and hyperpolarization measurements is only
found when transitions between parallel spin states dominate
(LB,C > LA,D).
Fitting residual-ﬁeld PLE spectra
The poles of the electromagnet used in these measurements generated a residual ﬁeld of B0 ∼36 G. For our
28Si sample, the Zeeman splitting from this residual ﬁeld
is comparable to the measured optical linewidth ΛPLE.
To account for this in our analysis, we ﬁt the residual
ﬁeld spectra to an ensemble average of Eq. 2 with Bz
along the ⟨100⟩axis and take Γ = ΛPLE.
For the
natSi and SOI samples where the lineshape is better described by the Gauss-Lorentz product (GLP), we deﬁne the GLP linewidth to be Γ =

Hyperpolarization model linecuts
In Fig. 2c of the main text, we measure T centre hyperpolarization in our 28Si sample at 4.2 K and compare the
measured data to the behaviour predicted by the hyperpolarization model developed in the text. As additional
comparison, we plot the simulated 2d data in Fig. 9a. We
then ﬁt both the measured and the modeled PLE spectra to Lorentzian lineshapes and plot the ﬁtted linewidths
