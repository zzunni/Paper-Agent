We describe a fabrication stackup for digital logic with 16 superconducting NbTiN layers, self-shunted α-silicon barrier
Josephson Junctions (JJs), and low loss, high-κ tunable hafnium–zirconium oxide (HZO) capacitors. The stack enables
400 MJJ/cm2 device density, efﬁcient routing, and AC power distribution on a resonant network. The materials scale
beyond 28 nm lithography and are compatible with standard high-temperature CMOS processes. We report initial results for two-metal layer NbTiN wires with 50 nm critical dimension. A semi-damascene wire-and-via process module
using 193i lithography and 50 nm critical dimension has shown cross-section uniformity of 1%/1σ across the 300 mm
wafer, critical temperature of 12.5 K, and critical current of 0.1 mA at 4.2 K. We also present a design of the resonant
AC power network enabled by NbTiN wires and HZO MIM capacitors. The design matches the device density and
provides a 30 GHz clock with estimated efﬁciency of up to 90%. Finally, magnetic imaging of patterned NbTiN ground
planes shows low intrinsic defectivity and consistent trapping of vortices in 0.5 µm holes spaced on a 20×20 µm2 grid.

INTRODUCTION
Unsustainable demand for compute power and unsustainable production hardware cost1,2 open the door to new technology in the post-Moore era. Superconducting digital logic
has the potential to provide a sustainable solution for largescale compute applications positioned between mature CMOS
and long-horizon quantum computing.
The differentiators
for superconducting digital are energy efﬁciency, high computational density, and high interconnect bandwidth. These
features uniquely enable real-time AI training models and
greater inclusiveness by distributing to edge systems compute power that currently must be deployed in a centralized data center. Development of a superconducting ecosystem would enable this market and would also enable tactical applications in communications3 and signal processing4,
and would lead to further innovations in areas ranging from
quantum computing5 to reversible logic6 and neuromorphic
computing7.
While superconducting integrated circuits have existed for
decades at a certain modest device count, success in scaling
further has met with challenges. Three major limitations include feature size and layer count in the fabrication process,
power distribution to current-bias the Josephson junctions,
and superconducting ﬂux trapping failures. In this paper we
report progress in all of these areas, centered around a fabrication stack with the required features enabled by an updated
materials set.
All state-of-art superconducting fabrication processes for
digital circuits are Nb-based8–11. As an elemental superconductor, Nb has a relatively high critical temperature of 9.2 K
and can be fabricated using conventional DC sputtering and
etch. However, processes scaled to an increased number of
metal layers and feature sizes down to 0.25 µm have run into
fundamental limitations. Problems include 1) unstable material properties caused by a low diffusion constant and complex
oxidation, affecting tolerances at sub-micron dimensions12–16
2) low inductance per unit length17,18 limiting routing density and signal integrity, 3) microwave losses due to inherent materials properties and an easily contaminated surface19,
and 4) a low processing temperature requirement20. Nb exhibits degradation of the superconducting properties top-tobottom through the stack due to the cumulative effects of fabrication processing21. Wire critical temperature distributions
vary widely from process-to-process and from wafer-to-wafer.
Further degradation due to hydrogen poisoning is reported22.
The low processing temperature is incompatible with standard
industry dielectric process23, with the overall effect limiting
feature size, layer count, and process control.
Fabrication of Nb/AlOx/Nb Josephson Junctions (JJs) is accessible to both academia and industry labs, but these junctions are at the limit of scalability as 1) the barrier is too thin
to scale to higher critical current densities without degradation
of junction quality resulting in increased losses and spreads24,
2) the capacitance of the barrier limits device speed25, and
3) the low thermal budget of 150-200◦C26 compromises subsequent fabrication processing of the backend.
Integration
density has not exceeded 1 MJJ/cm2 with only four layers
of metal27, and has not exceeded 100 kJJ/cm2 with eight
layers28. Published approaches for further increase in integration density are based on “self-shunted” junctions with lossy
barriers. Lossy barriers compromise circuit performance by
increasing fabrication spread in the case of high-Jc ultra-thin
barrier AlOx junctions29, or by reducing speed in the case of
Nb-doped Si junctions30,31.
Current fabrication technology does not support efﬁcient
implementation of AC power distribution. An industry shift
from DC power to resonant AC was a major advance for

energy efﬁciency, scalability, timing, and gate-delay of superconducting digital circuits27,32–35. However, the most advanced AC resonator networks are limited in density and
power-efﬁciency due to the lack of critical fabrication features. The geometric transformer used at every bias tap limits
integration scale to about 4 MJJs/cm2. Further miniaturization
of the transformer increases the input power and on-chip dissipation. Proposals for capacitive coupling36,37 would enable
higher integration scale but requires small, high-κ MIM capacitors. Static power dissipation in the resonator may dominate the total power budget, arising from losses in the Nb
wires and dielectrics. AC power distribution across multiple
chips is constrained by a lack of tunability of the high-Q resonant power network, needed to compensate for fabricationinduced resonance frequency spreads.
The largest SFQ circuits have been powered by low-speed
meander lines27,28, but meander lines at GHz frequencies have
shown limitations due to reﬂections of the traveling waves in
the package, speed-of-light uncertainty on-chip, and power
dissipation38. A meander-line 4-bit AQFP CPU was demonstrated at 100 kHz, and subcomponents at 2.5 GHz. A resonant clock network based on standing waves was ﬁrst put forward in the context of QFPs39 and was ﬁnally demonstrated
in RQL40, with small circuits operating at 10 GHz and circuits
of 40,000 JJs at 3 GHz. Further scaling was limited by the
large physical size of the transformer in each bias tap. Scaling
of superconductor ICs requires fundamental changes to move
beyond all of these limitations.
II.
FABRICATION STACK
We propose three process modules: NbTiN high-kineticinductance wires, Nb/Si/Nb Josephson junctions with selfaligned shunts, and tunable HZO MIM capacitors.
All of
these materials have been explored and developed in other
contexts, but have not been applied to digital integrated circuits. Fig. 1 shows our proposqed fabrication stack with 16
metal layers and two ground planes dedicated to ﬂux-trapping
mitigation. Current development is at the level of two metal
layers. The stack has balanced resources supporting an integration of 400 MJJs/cm2 matched to HZO-capacitor bias taps,
6 NbTiN backend routing layers with resistors implemented
as vias, and 4 NbTiN layers for resonant power distribution.
The high kinetic inductance of the wiring supports the high
density of junctions and bias taps. In a companion paper41,
we present circuit designs and projected performance of logic
and memory mapped onto the fabrication stack.
The frontend of the stack is based on α-Si barrier junctions
with high quality factor, small capacitance, and integrated
shunts. Such junctions meet circuit performance and density
requirements: high critical current, high quality, low capacitance, high reproducibility, and tolerance of high temperature
processing. These junctions were introduced decades ago42,43
with impressive characteristics and have recently come back
into use44. Relative to Nb/AlOx/Nb, Si-based junctions have
10× the critical current density at 4× thicker barrier. Critical current density of 100 µA/µm2 produces a 35 µA miniNbTiN

mum junctions with a diameter of 0.21 µm. The small capacitance of these junctions enables them to reach the fundamental
switching speed of 1.1 ps based on a gap of 1.8 mV, resulting
in 3× reduced gate latency. At the 193i lithography node the
total area of each junction instance is less than 0.25 µm2 including the via to the base electrode and integrated shunts.
A resistive passivation with ρ ≈1mΩcm can act as a selfaligned donut shunt resistor.
The backend process is based on NbTiN wires recently introduced by the quantum and RF superconducting communities driven by the need for small dimensions and extremely
low losses45–48. Stable and controllable material parameters
are a fundamental advantage of this choice. Relative to Nb,
NbTiN has up to a 1.8× higher critical temperature at 17.3 K,
and a 1.8× higher gap voltage at 5.2 mV. Ti is a nitrogen getter, so higher Ti composition produces a lower number of vacancies and high stability, with processing temperatures up
to 1,000 C46,48–50. NbTiN interconnects have extremely low

microwave surface resistance51,52 that translates into a 10×
higher throughput and 10× less energy per bit compared to
Nb. Reported NbTiN wires exhibit stable superconducting
properties down to a 10×10 nm2 cross section with a critical
temperature up to 15 K and a critical current density of 140200 mA/µm2 (see51 and references thereof). NbTiN has a 4×
lower resistivity translating into a 2× higher critical current
than NbN53.
The high kinetic inductance of NbTiN enables physically
small, ﬁxed-inductance-target interconnect without meanders,
and upholds signal integrity at deep-submicron by minimizing
parasitic mutual inductance arising from the geometric inductance. Target inductance values have low sensitivity to the
placement of ground planes and interlayer dielectric (ILD)
thickness. A central feature is the ability to design routes to
ﬁxed-inductance targets through utilization of layers with different cross-sections that produce a 10× spread in inductance
per unit length. Three pairs of routing layers, labeled M1M6 in Fig. 1, with ﬁne features (50 nm) on the bottom of the
stack and coarse features (200 nm) on top, are modeled after
CMOS. This methodology would be suitable for inductive and
PTL routes using commercial place and route algorithms.
Fabrication of high-kinetic-inductance NbTiN wires requires tight control on wire cross-section that is consistent
with 193i lithography and 300 mm wafers. Recent progress
on a NbTiN backend process reported by imec54 shows 50 nm
critical-dimension (CD) wires with cross-wafer CD onesigma of 1%. The process follows imec’s advances in semidamascene Ru with 12 nm CD for advanced-node CMOS,
with cross-section one-sigma of 1% at 12 nm feature size55.
Semi-damascene achieves high yield and tight cross-section
control by wire etch and low-aspect-ratio via ﬁll. Two layers of patterned NbTiN, shown in Fig 1b, have a measured
critical temperature of 12.5 K and critical current density of
8 mA/µm2, consistent with a ﬁlm resistivity of 160 µΩcm and
penetration depth of 380 nm56. Tested samples had ﬁlm thicknesses of 50 & 100 nm, and wire widths of 50-250 nm. Structures up to 100 µm show no degradation of superconducting
properties as a function of length.
NbTiN wires and high-κ HZO MIM capacitors form the basis for low-loss, tunable resonant AC power distribution. HZO
has been extensively studied in the context of FeFETs and
MMICs57,58. The capacitors can be fabricated using established ALD processes59 to support high dielectric constants up
to 38, high reproducibility, and tolerance of high temperature
processing. Tunable HZO capacitors with 10% tunability with
applied voltage have recently been reported for room temperature applications in logic, memory, and MMICs60–62. Tunability with DC voltage is the key to practical high-Q designs,
and does not create additional energy dissipation.
Losses
in the resonator will be dominated by the interlayer dielectric and capacitors, with a negligible contribution from the
NbTiN wires. Low-loss α-Si dielectric has been reported50
in resonators with tan(δ) < 10−5. Experiments are required
to determine and optimize capacitor losses at cryo temperatures. Based on results for metallic oxides in quantum computing applications63, we project a resonator quality factor of
Q = 105, which represents a 100× improvement over SiO2
capacitors for Nb-based superconductor processes.
III.
AC POWER DISTRIBUTION
The power layers of the fabrication stack are designed for a
high integration density implementation of the AC power network with a 2D array of tightly-coupled local LC resonators
as shown in Fig. 2a. The design balances multiple features
including density of bias taps, efﬁcient use of metal layers,
energy efﬁciency, clean resonance mode structure, and tunable frequency. The design has a 30 GHz clock frequency and
400 M bias taps per 1×1 cm2. Density is achieved by shunting the JJs with lumped LC resonators as shown in Fig. 2b. A
critical design feature is that inductance scales inversely with
number of Josephson junctions. The inductance of a combined 100 taps is 10,000 times smaller than that of 100 individual taps. In the proposed stack, a 5×5 µm2 area accommodates 100 JJs with average critical current of 42 µA and
a corresponding 100 HZO MIM capacitors with an average
2.6 fF. The maximum number of the JJs per tile is set by the
bias current through the inductor, which must be within the
critical current of the high kinetic inductance wire that scales
with wire cross-section. The NbTiN wire with cross-section
200 nm×200 nm has a critical current up to 5 mA. This constraint sets the number of junctions per tile.
Scaling the design to 30 GHz and large chip area of
1×1 cm2 is achieved by coupling LC tiles with a 2D inductive mesh. This ideal network presents a zero-order mode
resonance with uniform amplitude and phase. The LC resonance frequencies however changes over larger chip areas due
to variation in materials and processes. Tuneable HZO capacitors are therefore introduced to improve homogeneity of the
resonance frequency across-chip. Capacitance is tuned over
10% by adjusting the DC bias across the capacitor.
Practical aspects of the design include the feed network,
illustrated in Fig. 2c, that transforms impedance and stabilizes the desired zero-order mode. The impedance of an individual LC resonator tile is two orders of magnitude higher
than the characteristic impedance of the biased JJs, but the
impedance of 4 M tiles in parallel is still much lower than the
50 Ωsource. Implementation of the feed network is based on
the same lumped-LC layout style as the primary resonators,
with a progressive decrease in the number of tiles per stage
in the feed network, producing the corresponding increase in
impedance. In this way a hierarchical structure of LC resonators is formed. The number of connections between layers is optimized to cancel parasitic resonances by providing a
regular grid of feed points, and to keep current at any point
of the network below 3 mA. Inductance of the 2D mesh is invariant between all layers of the feed network. Capacitance at
the highest level is dominated by mesh-based parasitics to the
ground, which the design must take into account.
Another constraint on the power distribution is amplitude
stability across variable JJ switching activity. High switching
activity loads the network and reduces amplitude. The variation can be expressed as

room temperature and QJJ the quality factor of the JJ dynamic switching. Stability is guaranteed when the external
quality factor of the resonator is sufﬁciently low compared to
the quality factor of dynamic switching. The desired external quality factor is achieved in the design of the matching
network.
Not all AC power from the LC resonators is consumed by
switching JJs. Part of it is lost inside the capacitor and inductor of the resonator. Well below the critical temperature,
the loss in the NbTiN inductor is so low47 that only the loss
in the capacitpr dielectric is signiﬁcant. The quality factor of
the material loss is therefore Qmat ≈Qdiel = 1/tanδ, the inverse of the loss tangent of the capacitor dielectric. The useful
power consumed by the switching JJs has an associated quality factor QJJ = I2
JJ/(α4π f 2
r CrEJJ) with α the activity factor
and fr the clock frequency. Cr, IJJ and EJJ are parameters for
a 5×5 µm2 tile of 100 switching JJs: Cr is the resonator capacitance for one tile, IJJ and EJJ are respectively the total bias
current and total switching energy for 100 JJs in one tile. The

The efﬁciency is dependent on the activity factor and improves
with clock frequency as shown in Fig. 2d. The dynamic power
consumption of the JJs is determined with a bias current IJJ of
2.94 mA and energy consumption EJJ of 2.87 aJ for 100 JJs in
one tile. A tile capacitor of 0.26 pF with a loss tangent of 10−4
is used in the efﬁciency calculation. At 30 GHz, efﬁciency of
90% is achieved at a high activity factor of 1, and 65% is
achieved at an activity factor of 0.21 that corresponds to the
practical case in efﬁcient logic designs.
IV.
FLUX TRAPPING
Advanced materials and fabrication development would
be incomplete without characterization of ﬂux trapping,
which causes variability in the circuit cooldown to cooldown.
This has historically been a dominant failure mechanism.
Pearl vortices form in the ground plane during cooldown
through the superconducting transition temperature64, producing parasitic-ﬂux coupling to the active circuit. The parasitic coupling is up to one-half of an SFQ, Φ0/2, if the vortex
is located directly under the wire.
Ginzburg-Landau theory65 describes the physics of vortex
motion. Two characteristic energies and two material constants determine vortex dynamics: magnetic ﬁeld energy that
depends on London penetration depth, and pinning energy
that depends on coherence length.
In practice, defectivity
of the material affects pinning energy and viscosity of the
vortex66. The potential of the vortex can be calculated analytically in simple cases67,68 and can be simulated in complex geometries69–71. The materials aspect of ﬂux trapping
has been studied in the cavity and high current communities,
as unpinned vortices are a major source of loss and reduced

plane reside in the holes.
critical current72,73. These communities have put extensive
effort into material optimization and characterization of pinning parameters.
The effort in the digital community has been on design
of ground plane voids, or moats, to attract and sequester
the ﬂux. Moat design has been treated empirically through
the scanning squid microscopy measurements74 of different
geometries75,76. Historically, moat design was not fully effective simply because the moats were spaced too far apart.
A conceptual breakthrough occurred when patterned strips of
Nb less than 20 µm wide were shown to completely expel
ﬂux77. In the context of ICs, this translates to long moats
spaced less than 20 µm apart, which have been effective for
large, linear circuits27,28. Long moats are incompatible with
X-Y routing in large circuits. Instead, a regular grid of smaller
moats has been adopted with established design rules for moat
coupling78,79.
Alternately, design tools80 and modeling81
have been proposed to evaluate ad-hoc moat placement, but
these tools consider only the magnetic energy of the vortex,
neglecting material defects.
While mitigations have improved, allowing circuit scale
and complexity to increase, the best understandings of parasitic ﬂux mitigation have not been fully implemented due to
limitations imposed by materials and fabrication. Flux mitigation must start with the fabrication stack including material
stability and control, enabling dedicated ground planes with
a relatively high critical temperature81, electrically isolated
from the rest of the circuit79. The miniaturization that comes
with advanced fabrication nodes would only improve ﬂux performance by placing the moats closer together. The fabrication stack described here answers to all the above. NbTiN
ground planes top and bottom have critical temperature that
can be engineered with material composition.
Fig. 3 shows ﬂux images of the NbTiN ground plane fabricated in the same process as the wires and patterned into
either strips or a grid of holes. Images can be directly compared to similar experiments done with Nb77,82,83. The primary ﬁgure of merit in these experiments is the critical ﬁeld,
Bm corresponding to onset of the ﬁrst vortex trapped in the
ground plane. The critical ﬁeld as function of strip width is
a direct measure of the material parameters of the ﬁlm53,77,84.
The critical ﬁeld of the 10 µm NbTiN strip, BNbTiN
m
≈40µT,
is less than the published value for Nb, BNb
m ≈60µT for a ﬁlm
thickness of 210 nm. The measured critical ﬁeld for NbTiN
depends on the ﬁlm thickness, 45 µT for 50 nm and 40 µT for
100 nm. The decrease in critical ﬁeld relative to Nb follows
an increase of the Ginsburg-Landau constant κ ≈80 for a coherence length of 5 nm46 and penetration depth of 380 nm estimated from the normal-state resistivity and superconducting
critical temperature of the ﬁlms56.
The NbTiN images in Fig. 3 show that internal defectivity
of the material is quite low. Internal pinning of the material is
characterized by distances from a trapped vortex to the centerline and to the edge of the strip. The position of the vortices
in the 100 nm ﬁlm are near the centerline and there are no
consistent pinning centers. The 50 nm ﬁlm images do show
consistent defects, including one that is close to the edge of
the ﬁlm. The difference between the two ﬁlms might be explained by columnar growth of NbTiN ﬁlm with grain boundaries averaging out with an increase of the thickness. Finally,
the patterned ground plane with 0.5 µm holes spaced 20 µm
apart shows consistent pinning in the holes at an applied ﬁeld

up to 240 nT, typical of digital circuits in a passively shielded
environment. The hole size and spacing is consistent with
high integration density of the stack consuming less than 1%
of the total area on the chip and allowing for dense routing
with minimal blockages.
V.
CONCLUSION
We have proposed a superconductor integrated circuit fabrication stack with a materials set that provides a foundation for 400 MJJ/cm2 integration scale in digital superconducting circuits.
Fabrication processes for NbTiN wireup,
low-capacitance α-silicon barrier JJs, and low loss, high-κ
tunable HZO capacitors are compatible with 300 mm CMOS
processes and thermal budgets. The stack uses standard interlayer dielectric processes and 28 nm lithography. Initial fabrication and test cycles have shown wires with properties meeting the design requirements and good ﬂux trapping properties
sufﬁcient for large scale integrated circuits. Further development is progressing with Josephson junctions and MIM capacitors. The fabrication stack has been codeveloped with a
resonant clock network scalable for 400M taps in a chip area
of 1×1 cm2 and clock frequency of 30 GHz. In a companion
paper41 we present circuit designs for logic and memory built
on this foundation.
