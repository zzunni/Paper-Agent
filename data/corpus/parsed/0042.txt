Abstract 
With shrinking dimensions in integrated circuits, sensors, and functional devices, there is 
a pressing need to develop nanofabrication techniques with simultaneous control of morphology, 
microstructure, and material composition over wafer length scales. Current techniques are largely 
unable to meet all these conditions, suffering from poor control of morphology and defect structure 
or requiring extensive optimization or post-processing to achieve desired nanostructures. Recently, 
thermomechanical nanomolding (TMNM) has been shown to yield single-crystalline, high aspect 
ratio nanowires of metals, alloys, and intermetallics over wafer-scale distances. Here, we extend 
TMNM for wafer-scale fabrication of 2D nanostructures. Using Cu, we successfully nanomold Cu 
nanoribbons with widths < 50 nm, depths ~ 0.5-1 µm and lengths ~ 7 mm into Si trenches at 
conditions compatible with back end of line processing. Through SEM cross-section imaging and 
4D-STEM grain orientation maps, we show that the grain size of the bulk feedstock is transferred 
to the nanomolded structures up to and including single crystal Cu. Based on the retained 
microstructures of molded 2D Cu, we discuss the deformation mechanism during molding for 2D 
TMNM.

Introduction 
 
The ability to fabricate increasingly complex nanostructures is the backbone of numerous 
advances in wide ranging fields including catalysis1, energy storage2, integrated circuits3, 
plasmonics4, and biomedical diagnostics5. However, a nanofabrication approach that enables 
simultaneous control over crystallinity, size, morphology, and material composition remains 
elusive. Bottom-up techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and atomic layer deposition can 
fabricate exceptionally high quality single crystalline films and coatings but largely fail at 
fabrication of other more complex nanostructures6,7. Further, these techniques do not readily 
translate to different material classes, require extensive optimization for each material composition 
of interest, and control of grain size and orientation is limited or dictated by the underlying 
substrate. Colloidal synthesis can achieve excellent size, shape, and composition control but this 
technique is limited to 0D or 1D nanostructures, requires surface ligands to stabilize in solution, 
and cannot be easily integrated with other nanofabrication techniques or cleanroom processing8.

Micro-additive manufacturing, such as two-photon lithography or electrohydrodynamic redox 3D 
printing, enables arbitrary control of morphology and rapid optimization but is limited to few 
material classes, cannot be performed over large areas due to the limitations of the rastering of a 
laser or a tip, and the final structures are nanoporous9,10. Top-down techniques, such as 
lithography, enable control of morphology and size but are extremely limited in material choice 
and lack control of crystallinity.  
 
Recently, thermomechanical nanomolding (TMNM), a technique whereby a bulk 
feedstock of a desired material is pressed through a nanoporous mold at elevated temperatures and 
pressures, has been shown to yield high aspect ratio single crystal nanowires over wafer-scale 
distances11,12. TMNM is material-agnostic, having been shown to work for a wide variety of 
materials including metals11,13, alloys11, and intermetallics14,15. TMNM of 1D nanowires relies on 
initial grain reorientation near the base of the nanowire as the bulk feedstock enters the nanopores 
of the mold to the preferred growth direction, which minimizes total surface energy and interfacial 
diffusion barrier along the mold walls12. While 1D TMNM can form nanowires of a desired 
material, most applications require the ability to fabricate more complex and higher dimensional 
nanostructures. At present, it is unknown whether interfacial diffusion will still occur during 
TMNM to form nanostructures beyond nanowires, which have different boundary conditions and 
surface area to volume ratios, and if additional growth mechanisms are at play.  
 
Here, we use TMNM to form 2D Cu nanostructures inside Si3N4/Si trenches. Using Cu 
feedstocks with varying grain sizes, we observe successful TMNM over millimeter length scales 
of 2D nanostructures with high aspect ratios up to 50. Importantly, the molded 2D Cu 
nanostructures retain the same grain size of the Cu feedstock, from nanoscale grains to single 
crystal. The conditions used for TMNM are back end of line (BEOL) compatible and scalable, 
enabling future integration with semiconductor processing. 
Results 
TMNM in 2D requires a bulk feedstock of the material of interest along with a mold (Figure 
1a) pressed together at elevated temperature and pressure. We use 2D Si trenches fabricated using 
traditional lithographic techniques as the mold for TMNM (Figure 1b). The trenches have either a 
width of ~20 or ~40 nm with depths of 500 or 1000 nm. These trenches have a ~100 nm thick 
Si3N4 barrier layer to prevent silicide formation at elevated temperatures. For each molding 
experiment, a 7 mm x 7 mm size wafer is used. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1a. For 
the experiments, three Cu samples were used with different grain sizes: nanocrystalline Cu (ncCu) with grain sizes ranging between 50 nm - 7 µm (Figure 1c), microcrystalline Cu (µc-Cu) with  
grain sizes ranging from 1 - 60 µm (Figure 1d), and a <110>-oriented single crystal Cu (sc-Cu). 
All TMNM was done in an argon environment to prevent Cu oxidation during molding at elevated 
temperatures. A pressure of 30 MPa was used for TMNM of nc-Cu foils and 60 MPa for µc-Cu. 
These pressures did not lead to crack formation in the Si wafer. After TMNM, the remaining Cu 
foil was removed manually using tweezers and no further processing or cleaning was performed.

Successful 2D TMNM of the nc-Cu foil is observed using an optical microscope over an 
extremely large area (Figure 2a). An optical image of a larger region is shown in Supplementary 
Figure 1. Cross-section SEM imaging shows complete molding with Cu thoroughly filling the 
trenches to form Cu nanoribbons (Figure 2b). SEM imaging along the trench shows the grain size 
and morphology (Figure 2c). The extent of TMNM is both time and temperature dependent. At 
200°C (0.35Tm where Tm is the melting temperature of bulk Cu), TMNM was not successful. At 
300°C (0.42Tm) and 60 minutes, TMNM produces incomplete molding where gaps remain 
between the bottom of the trench and molded Cu. These gaps are found at the interface between 
Cu grains with sharp angles (Figure 2c, top). Increasing the temperature to 400°C (0.5Tm) led to 
more complete nanomolding with minimal gaps near the end of the mold (Figure 2c, middle). 
400°C and 90 minutes was determined to be the ideal nanomolding conditions for nc-Cu (Figure 
2c, bottom and Supplementary Figure 2). Whereas 1D TMNM always led to single crystal 
nanowires13, we observe that 2D TMNM of nc-Cu led to the nanocrystalline grains and twins in 
the molded Cu ribbons with comparable sizes to the nc-Cu feedstock. The grain shape is random, 
with no directional or columnar grain structure, which suggests no preferred grain reorientation 
occurs during 2D TMNM. We also successfully nanomolded large aspect ratio Cu ribbons with a 
width of 20 nm and depth of 1 µm (Figure 2e) at 400°C, 30 MPa, and 90 minutes with nc-Cu. 
There is no difference in grain shape or structure with the increased aspect ratio.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of liftout samples of Cufilled trenches shows no apparent intermixing of Cu and Si at the Cu/ Si3N4 interface and complete 
molding for nc-Cu at 400°C and 90 minutes (Figure 3a). 4D-STEM maps of the nanomolded 
trenches were collected to determine grain orientation of the molded nc-Cu in the trenches using 
electron diffraction patterns16 (Figure 3a). For the nc-Cu foil, the molded Cu show a variety of 
grain structures, ranging from high angle grain boundaries (Figure 3b) to low angle grain 
boundaries and single crystal trenches (Figure 3c). In the low angle grain boundary case, plotting 
grain boundary misorientation angle along the nanomolding direction shows a gradual rotation in 
the crystal before the grain boundary, whereas intragranular rotations in the single crystal case is 
random (Figure 3c). The polycrystalline nature is also observed in a partially molded nc-Cu trench  
at 300°C, 30 MPa, and 90 minutes, indicating that the grains are present during the entire 
nanomolding process (Figure 3d). A variety of grain structures were also seen for nanomolded ncCu at 300°C, 30 MPa, and 90 minutes (Supplementary Figure 3).

A higher pressure of 60 MPa was needed to achieve successful nanomolding for µc-Cu. 
Surprisingly, when TMNM was performed with µc-Cu foil at 400°C and for 90 minutes, we see 
little intensity contrast in SEM cross-section images and larger grain sizes compared to nc-Cu 
(Figure 4a). Thus, the molded Cu retains the large grains of the original µc-Cu feedstock. At the 
single crystal limit using <110>-oriented Cu, nanomolding was strongly dependent on the 
orientation of the crystal with respect to the trench walls. When {111} planes were not parallel to 
the trench wall, nanomolding at 400°C and ~100 MPa was unsuccessful. Higher pressures were 
not feasible since they led to extensive cracking in the Si wafer. When Cu {111} planes were 
aligned parallel to the trench wall, nanomolding at 400°C, 70 MPa, and 90 minutes was successful 
(Figure 4b). In addition to Cu trench formation, we also form freestanding 2D Cu fins (Figure 4c). 
Here, we use the sc-Cu as the feedstock and etch away the Si and Si3N4 after molding. 4D-STEM 
grain orientation maps of the Cu fins show that the orientation of the fins matches the orientation 
of the bulk feedstock with the <111> direction aligned with the trench wall, the <211> direction 
aligned along the length of the trench, and the <110> direction aligned with the nanomolding 
direction (Figure 4d, Figure 4e, Supplementary Figure 4, and Supplementary Figure 5).

Discussion on diffusion mechanism in 2D TMNM 
The different microstructures observed in nanomolded Cu enable us to identify the 
potential growth mechanisms for TMNM in 2D. As with 1D, 2D TMNM is both time and 
temperature dependent with increased temperature promoting more complete molding. There is a 
slight pressure increase necessary to mold nc-Cu (30 MPa), µc-Cu (60 MPa), and sc-Cu (70 MPa). 
The lack of any consistent grain orientation in nc-Cu, the presence of grains in partially molded 
samples, and comparable grain size in molded Cu with grain size in the bulk feedstock indicate 
that the microstructure of the feedstock is conserved during molding. Finally, sc-Cu was only 
successfully nanomolded when {111} planes were aligned with the walls of the trench, matching 
what is expected from 1D TMNM. 
Here, we discuss differences between 1D and 2D TMNM. TMNM in 1D is driven by 
crystal reorientation at the base of the nanowire to minimize surface energy followed by interfacial 
diffusion along the mold wall11. In the case of FCC metals such as Cu, the preferred molding 
direction is <110>, which maximizes the area of {111} planes on the nanowire surface since it has 
the lowest surface energy. If crystal reorientation occurred in the trenches to minimize surface 
energy for TMNM in 2D, we expect preferred grain orientations that would lower the surface 
energy of the molded nc-Cu samples, which we did not observe. We estimate the surface energy 
for the planes facing the trench wall from the orientation maps generated from 4D-STEM for the 
nc-Cu samples both at 300°C and 400°C. For both cases, there is no clear relation between the 
surface energy of the entrance grain and the final grain at the bottom of trench. For example, for 

===== Page 7 =====

the trench shown in Figure 3b, the grain near the mold entrance has ~(543) planes aligned with the 
trench wall, which have a surface energy of ~1.06 J/m2 17. The grain at the bottom of the trench 
has ~(771) aligned with the trench wall, which have a slightly higher surface energy of ~1.1 J/m2 
17. Similarly, the single crystal grain shown in Figure 3c has ~(421) planes aligned with the trench 
walls, which has a high surface energy of 1.14 J/m2, yet we observe no crystal rotation17. Thus, 
while {111} planes were highly preferred in the single crystal Cu molding (Figure 4), 
polycrystalline bulk feedstocks showed no clear preference as to grain orientation during molding.  
The lack of grain rotation in the case of 2D TMNM in contrast to 1D TMNM can partially 
be attributed to different boundary conditions during molding. In 1D TMNM, there is a high 
probability for a random grain to have a set of {111} planes oriented on the mold walls as the mold 
wall surrounds the grain. In 1D TMNM, once the grain has the <110>-direction aligned with the 
molding direction, there will always be {111} planes aligned with the mold walls. In 2D 
nanomolding, the grain must be oriented such that the <110>-direction is in the molding direction 
and {111} planes align with the trench wall. Thus, 2D TMNM requires more grain rotation for 
proper alignment, which could become a large energetic barrier. Experimentally, this was observed 
for the single crystal Cu molding where misaligned crystals did not mold even at high pressures 
of ~100 MPa.  
We instead attribute the resulting microstructure observed in 2D TMNM to grain boundary 
diffusion and subsequent grain boundary sliding resulting from diffusion. The predicted length of 
the molded nanowire in 1D TMNM, L, is shown in Equation 111: 
𝐿= √𝐿0

where L0 is related to the entry effect during molding, p is the pressure, D is the diffusion constant, 
Ω is the atomic volume, t is the molding time, kb is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, S is 
the cross-section area of the diffusion path, and A is the cross-section area of the mold. In 1D 
TMNM, interfacial diffusion of Cu on the mold surface drives formation of nanowires. For 2D 
TMNM, we include the contribution of grain boundary diffusion18, which leads to a modified 
equation:

where DI is the interfacial diffusivity, δI is the interfacial diffusion thickness layer (~ 1 nm)11, w is 
either diameter of the wire or width of the trench, δGB is the grain boundary diffusion thickness 
layer, dGB is the grain size, and DGB is the grain boundary diffusivity. From 1D TMNM 
experiments, DI has been shown to be comparable to DGB for most metals11, which leads to the 
simplification shown in Equation 3. Previous studies measuring δGB have varied widely with values 
ranging between 0.5 nm - 1 µm19–21. Using the successful molding conditions of nc-Cu and single 
crystal Cu, we estimate that δGB is ~20 nm. Thus, GB diffusion can dominate TMNM for small 
grain sizes and play a significant role in microcrystalline grain sizes as well. From Equation 3, we

−𝛼, where α is between 2-3. This 
does not match the experimental data since the pressure difference for molding was double 
between nc-Cu and µc-Cu while the grain size difference was approximately 10x. 
Any appreciable grain boundary diffusion in polycrystal samples must occur 
simultaneously with grain boundary sliding to conserve volume, prevent void formation, and 
prevent grain overlap22–26. Importantly, grain boundary sliding conserves grain orientation since 
grains slide past one another rather than rotating or growing. There are two dominant grain 
boundary sliding mechanisms: Rachinger sliding25 that leads to minimal change in grain size and 
shape and Lifshitz sliding22 that leads to elongated, columnar grains due to the motion of vacancies 
perpendicular to the stress direction. Since we did not observe any change in grain size or any 
noticeable grain elongation (Figure 2), we predict that Rachinger sliding is the dominant 
mechanism. 
 
In conclusion, we successfully show 2D TMNM over large length scales making it a viable 
technique for wafer-scale fabrication of 2D nanostructures at BEOL compatible conditions. Since 
TMNM is a material-agnostic technique, the same approach can be used to fabricate 2D 
nanostructures of a wide variety of compounds including other metals, alloys, intermetallics, and 
metallic glasses. The simultaneous control of both morphology and grain size during 2D TMNM 
can be useful for a wide array of applications where current nanofabrication techniques are the 
bottleneck for further advancements. In the context of interconnects, fabrication of high aspect 
ratio single crystal Cu nanostructures can greatly reduce resistivity by mitigating grain boundary 
scattering27, which currently limits further interconnect scaling via Damascene process28. For 
catalysis, increasing grain boundary density in nanostructures has been shown to increase catalytic 
activity compared to pristine surfaces29. For mechanical metamaterials such as nanolattices, 
nanocrystalline grain boundaries act as boundaries for dislocation motion, leading to enhanced 
strength and toughness30.  
Methods 
Si Trench Fabrication for 2D Mold 
The following steps were taken to fabricate an 8-inch Si wafer with a 20 ~ 40 nm gap trenches 
with a 1 μm pitch: thermal oxidation for hardmask formation with a 200 nm gap (1 μm pitch), 
followed by a photolithography process with a KrF scanner (ASML, PAS 5500/700D), hardmask 
etching (Lam Research, EXELAN-HPT), photoresist stripping (PSK, DAS-2000), post cleaning, 
silicon trench etching (Lam Research, TCP-9400DFM), another round of post cleaning, and hard 
mask removal through hydrofluoric acid. Finally, low-pressure nitride deposition (Centrotherm, 
E1200) for gap shrinkage to the target gap of 20 ~ 40 nm. The etching conditions were as follows: 
a mixture of CF4, Ar, and O2 for the Bottom Anti-Reflective Coating (BARC) etching, C4F8, Ar, 
and O2 for the oxide etching, and He, SF6, and O2 gases for silicon trench etching. After dicing 
into 7 mm x 7 mm sections, the diced wafers are cleaned in piranha solution before being 
transferred into the argon glovebox for TMNM. 
Thermomechanical Nanomolding 

===== Page 9 =====

Nanocrystalline 9 µm thick Cu foil (99.8% purity) was purchased from MTI. Microcrystalline 25 
µm thick Cu foil (99.8% purity) was purchased from ThermoScientific. No additional annealing 
or polishing was done on the foils. Before TMNM, the Cu foil is cleaned in acetic acid for 30 
seconds followed by blow-drying to remove the native oxide layer31. After transferring to an argon 
glove box, the Cu foil is placed on the Si wafer with trenches and the combination is placed into a 
steel die. All samples were first brought up to the final temperature at a ramp rate of 10°C/min 
before applying pressure using a hot press. After TMNM, the remaining foil is manually removed 
from the wafer using tweezers. No further processing or annealing is performed after molding. 
For the single crystal sample, a pre-polished <110>-oriented Cu substrate was purchased from 
MTI. A Laue diffraction pattern was collected to determine the orientation of the (111) planes. 
From there the Cu substrate was rotated manually to orient (111) planes to be parallel to the trench 
walls before nanomolding. After TMNM, the Si was etched away using 15% KOH at 60°C 
followed by etching of the Si3N4 barrier layer using 5% HF.   
SEM cross-section imaging and EBSD 
SEM images were acquired using a Thermo Fisher Helios G4 UX Focused Ion Beam. EBSD maps 
were acquired using a Bruker eFlash HR EBSD in a Tescan Mira3 FESEM. The Cu foils were 
polished using a vibratory polisher with 70 nm colloidal silica for 3 hours for EBSD.   
STEM imaging and 4D-STEM maps 
Liftouts of Cu-filled trenches were made using a Thermo Fisher Helios G4 UX Focused Ion Beam 
with a final mill at 5 kV. STEM images were collected on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Spectra 300 
S/TEM at 300 kV. The liftouts were initially tilted to align the Si on the <100>-axis, which is also 
the nanomolding direction. All 4D-STEM maps were collected on an Electron Microscope Pixel 
Array Detector (EMPAD). Grain mapping was done using Py4DSTEM16. A minimum of 7 Bragg 
diffraction spots were used to determine grain orientation.
