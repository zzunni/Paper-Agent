Ge/SiGe heterostructures represent a promising platform for hosting various quantum devices such as hole spin qubits
and Andreev spin qubits. However, the compatibility of such heterostructures with high-quality-factor microwave
superconducting cavities remains a challenge due to defects in the material stack. In this work, we present an approach
to enhance the coherence of cavity modes on a reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure, which consists of etching the
full ∼1.6µm-thick Ge/SiGe stack down to its starting high-resistivity Si substrate, in order to pattern superconducting
cavities directly on it. We engineer the mesa step to be tapered, so that it can be easily climbed by the superconducting
cavities to reach the quantum devices potentially hosted in the Ge quantum well. Using this approach, we observe internal
quality factors of Qi ≈10000 −20000 for high-impedance frequency-tunable Josephson junction array resonators,
limited by the junctions’ fabrication, and Qi ≈100000 for 50 Ωcoplanar waveguide Nb lift-off resonators. These Qi are
preserved despite the overlap with the mesa structure in the climbing region, and are comparable to the ones obtained for
identical resonators fabricated on a high-resistivity Si wafer reference. Thereby, this work paves a practical path toward
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, immediately applicable to emerging technologies on planar Ge.
Planar Ge/SiGe heterostructures have recently emerged
as a prominent platform for scalable quantum computation
and simulation1–6.
2-dimensional hole gases (2DHG) in
Ge quantum wells (QW) can be engineered to encompass
mobilities exceeding 106 cm2/Vs7, a small effective mass
(mHH ≈0.05me)8, and low isotope populations with non-zero
nuclear spins9,10, all of which can be beneficial for quantum
dot (QD) hole spin qubits in Ge1–3. Significantly, holes in Ge
exhibit novel features such as a large spin-orbit interaction2,11,
an anisotropic gyromagnetic ratio tensor (g-tensor)12, and
a small contact hyperfine coupling to surrounding nuclear
spins13,14. These properties are also tunable via gate voltages12,
allowing all-electrical manipulation of the hole spin states1,2,
and in-situ optimization of the spin coherence1,12. Additionally, superconducting germanosilicide contacts in planar Ge
heterostructures15 provide novel paths to study Andreev bound
states (ABSs)16–18 and minimal Kitaev chains19 within planar
Ge heterostructures, also showcasing the significance of planar
Ge for various quantum device applications.
Superconducting cavities have been used to coherently interface microwave photons with various quantum systems20.
In this regard, embedding semiconductor quantum states into
superconducting cavities unlocks possibilities for novel quantum architectures, facilitating, for instance, high-fidelity spin
readout21, coherent interconnects between remote spins22,23,
microwave optics24,25, and readout and manipulation of An-

dreev bound states17,26,27. In such hybrid circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) approach28, achieving large holephoton coupling strengths and low photon loss rates (or large
internal quality factors Qi) of the resonators are needed for
realizing coherent hole-photon interfaces29–31. In this context, recent studies have demonstrated strong hole chargephoton coupling in Ge/SiGe hetrostructures, exploiting a
high-impedance superconducting resonator realized with a
SQUID array29 and a high-kinetic granular aluminum (grAl)
nanowire31. However, a substantial amount of defects present
in Ge/SiGe heterostructures greatly limits the internal quality
factor of the cavity modes in this platform to Qi ≈3000−5000
for forward-graded heterostructures31–33 and Qi ≈1000 for
reversed-graded ones34 in the low-photon regime, relevant in
some cQED applications20,28.
In this work, we present an approach to significantly reduce
the internal losses of superconducting cavities on planar Ge. It
consists of a tapered etching of the full heterostructure down to
the intrinsic Si substrate, leaving only a small mesa on planar
Ge for hosting semiconductor or hybrid super-semi devices.
We fabricate superconducting high-impedance (Zr = 3kΩ)
Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction (JJ) array resonators35 on the
etched heterostructure, which also climb over the tapered mesa
step, and show that the internal quality factor of the resonators
increases from Qi ≈3000 −4000 on the bare Ge/SiGe heterostructure, to Qi ≈10000−20000 on the etched structure.
These values match the ones obtained on an intrinsic Si substrate reference, suggesting that the obtained upper bound in
the Qi is not limited by the tapered etching process, but rather
by the Josephson junctions fabrication process. We confirm

FIG. 1. (a) Schematic of a Ge/SiGe heterostructure with a resonator defined on top of the structure. Defects, each denoted by two white parallel
lines in a circle, reside in various layers and interfaces of the heterostructure, and couple to the resonator (in yellow). (b) Schematic of a Ge/SiGe
heterostructure etched down to the Si substrate with a tapered mesa step. The resonator is patterned mainly on the Si substrate and its termination
climbs over the mesa to be connected to potential structures defined there. (c) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a Ge/SiGe
heterostructure after the tapered etching process. The etching leaves an approximately 45◦angled mesa step. An approximately 100nm-deep
trench is visible in the Si substrate, due to an increased ion scattering rate at the mask sidewall during the etching step (see Appendix A.3). As is
visible from the overetched region at the Ge virtual substrate, Ge is etched at a slightly faster rate than SiGe. (d) Schematic of five notch-type
Josephson junction (JJ) array resonators coupled to a 50Ωphoton feedline. (e) Optical micrograph of a JJ array resonator coupled to the 50Ω
feedline. The JJ array resonator is false-colored in yellow. One end of the resonator consists of a large pad shunting it to ground to form a
quarter-wave resonator, while the other end is climbing the mesa (purple shaded structure). A hook (colored in green) extends from the feedline
and defines the capacitive coupling between the feedline and the resonator. (f) SEM image of the JJ array resonator at the voltage antinode

this by fabricating low-impedance (Zr = 50Ω) coplanar waveguide (CPW) Nb lift-off resonators on the etched Ge/SiGe heterostructure which exhibit Qi ≈100000 at low-photon number.
Furthermore, we tune the inductance of the JJ arrays resonators
with an in-plane magnetic field parallel to the JJ arrays and
effectively modulate their resonance frequency (and hence the
impedance) in a wide-range of 4 −7GHz (5 −3kΩ), which
represents a useful resource for studying hybrid systems24.
We also characterize a degradation of the Qi down to ≈3000
as the magnetic field approaches the junctions’ critical field,
which can be attributed either to an increase of the quasiparticle population near such critical field36,37, or also to the creation of vortices in the proximity of the resonators38. This
work provides a systematic path toward optimizing a hybrid
cQED architecture on planar Ge, which can be highly beneficial for various quantum applications involving hole-photon
interactions16,29,31.
Figure 1a schematically represents the cross section of
a reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure that hosts defects
(white circles) throughout the material stack8,39. These defects can originate from amorphous materials, such as oxides
at the top interface40, impurities due to contaminants during
the growth process8,39,41, and threading dislocations due to
the lattice constant mismatch at the interfaces between different materials in the stack8,14,42. These can effectively act
as two-level fluctuators (TLFs), or result in buried conductive layers hosting free charge carriers introducing resistive
losses for the resonators . The microwave electric and magnetic field confined in superconducting cavities can couple
to these defects, effectively opening up channels for photon
dissipation34,43–46. As a result, superconducting resonators
defined on semiconductor heterostructures typically exhibit
internal quality factors few orders of magnitude smaller than
the ones on high-resistivity substrates such as intrinsic Si47,
which in contrast can reach up to Qi ≈106.
One of the main photon loss mechanisms on reverse-graded
Ge/SiGe heterostructures most likely stems from residual conductive layers located at the interface between the bottom
Si substrate and the Ge virtual substrate, due to the lattice
mismatch34.
For this reason, etching completely the heterostructure down to the bottom intrinsic Si substrate, and
defining the resonators directly on it, can effectively eliminate
the majority of the loss channels. In our work, we selectively
etch the Ge and SiGe layers (≈1.6µm thick) down to the bot-

tom high-resistive Si substrate (resistivity > 10kΩ·cm, see
Appendix A.1), leaving only relatively small mesa islands
(150µm ×150µm) for potentially hosting semiconductor devices in the Ge QW. The etch process results in a surface with
an extremely low roughness of ≈0.1nm on the Si substrate
and is engineered to provide a tapered profile on the mesa step,
facilitating connections from the bottom Si to the top SiGe and
further fabrication processing, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Details
about the etch process are provided in Appendix A.2. Fig. 1c
reports a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the
cross-section of the heterostructure after the etch process. Despite the Ge virtual substrate is etched slightly faster than SiGe,
the profile shows a smoothly tapered step48.
To investigate the microwave properties of the etched
heterostructure, we fabricate high-impedance (Zr = 3kΩ)
Al/AlOx/Al JJ array resonators on top of the Si substrate in the
etched region. As depicted in Fig. 1d, we couple five notchtype JJ array resonators, each with a distinct number of JJs, to
a single 50Ωphoton feedline49–51. The JJ arrays are defined
with the standard Dolan-bridge technique52, using two angled
evaporations at ±45◦53 (see Appendix A.3). The number of JJs
in a resonator (50 ≥N ≥42) determines its total inductance,
and therefore its resonance frequency fr (6GHz ≤fr ≤7GHz).
From room temperature resistance measurements of junction
test structures, we extract a resistance per JJ of RJJ ≈1.25kΩ,
corresponding to an inductance of LJJ ≈1.48nH, and a critical
current of Ic,JJ ≈220nA54. Given the JJ area, we also estimate
a ratio between Josephson and charging energy EJ/EC of about
180.
Figure 1e shows an optical micrograph of one of the notch
resonators, where the JJ array (false-colored in yellow) is
shunted to the ground plane at one end, and capacitively coupled to the photon feedline at the other end via a hook structure
(false-colored in green), resulting in a quarter-wave resonator20.
The capacitive coupling between the hook and the resonator
determines the external coupling rate κc and the external qual-

ity factor Qc = 2π fr/κc. To facilitate the galvanic connection
between the resonator and potential structures on top of the
mesa, we terminate the narrow JJ array with a wider and longer
junction, which does not significantly contribute to the total
inductance. In Fig. 1f we show that the angled evaporation
allows a successful climbing of the tapered mesa structure
(shaded in purple) without further optimization of the fabrication steps. We also probe the electrical conduction of twenty
similar test structures climbing the mesa, which are fabricated
on the same chip, and find that the climbing does not introduce
any disconnection, as can be anticipated from the smooth etch
profile shown in Fig. 1c.
To systematically quantify the effect of this etching approach
on the internal loss rates of JJ array resonators, we fabricate
nominally identical resonators on the bare Ge/SiGe heterostructure (Fig. 2a), on the etched Ge/SiGe heterostructure (Fig. 2b)
and on an intrinsic (resistivity ≈10kΩ·cm) Si reference substrate (Fig. 2c). We characterize the resonators by performing
microwave measurements in a dilution refrigerator at a base
temperature of 10 mK. See Appendix B for details about the
measurement setup.
We first explore the power dependence of the resonators’
spectrum. Fig. 2d presents the normalized feedline transmission amplitude |S21| as a function of the estimated drive power
Pd at the sample feedline (see Appendix B) and drive frequency
fd, measured around the resonance frequency of one of the
five notch resonators on the etched heterostructure with the
mesa climb (Fig. 2b). For the power spectroscopies of all resonators on all substrates, refer to Appendix F. Starting from
Pd ≈−130dBm, a decrease of the resonance frequency for
increasing Pd becomes distinguishable, which is attributed to
the Kerr nonlinearity of the JJs55,56. We fit the complex spectroscopy data at each individual power Pd < −130dBm to a
linear input-output theory model for notch-type resonators (see
Appendix E.1), from which we extract the resonance frequency
fr, the external coupling rate κc, the internal loss rate κi and
the average photon number ⟨Nph⟩at each value of Pd. From
the fit we extract that ⟨Nph⟩= 1 for Pd ≈−133dBm. We further fit numerically the full 2D spectroscopy data (Fig. 2j) to
an input-output model that takes into account the self-Kerr
nonlinearity (see Appendix E.2), as presented in Fig. 2e, and
extract the self-Kerr coefficient K = (99.5 ± 0.4)kHz. This
value is consistent with the expected one for N = 44 junctions and a single-junction charging energy EC ≈0.6GHz (see
Appendix F).
We perform similar measurements for all the resonators
on the three different substrates (see Appendix F), and report
their spectrum measured at a specific value of ⟨Nph⟩< 1 in
Figs. 2f-k, for one representative resonator on each substrate
type indicated in Figs. 2a-c. Solid lines in Figs. 2f-k present
the numerical fit to the linear input-output model for each spectrum. Figure 2l shows the Qi for all the resonators, extracted
from a numerical fit to the linear input-output model at the
low-photon-number regime ⟨Nph⟩< 1, relevant in some cQED
applications20,28 (see Appendix G for the extracted Qc of all
the resonators). For ⟨Nph⟩> 1, the large self-Kerr nonlinearity
of the JJ array resonators complicates an accurate estimation
of the Qi, as explained in Appendix E.2. In Figure 2l, different

shades of the same color denote the different resonators on the
same substrate with a distinct number of JJs. The resonators
on the same substrate exhibit consistent values of Qi regardless
of the number of JJs. We observe that the Qi remain relatively
constant over the range of ⟨Nph⟩shown in Fig. 2l. This is expected when ⟨Nph⟩≪nc, with nc the critical photon number at
which the TLF-induced losses would start becoming negligible
compared to other losses36,57.
Notably, Fig. 2l shows that the resonators on the etched heterostructure feature Qi ≈10000−20000 (pink data), systematically outperforming those on the bare heterostructure showing
Qi ≈3000−4000 (green data). This clearly demonstrates that
the etching technique is effectively eliminating potential loss

channels residing in the heterostructure, enhancing the lifetime
of the photons in the resonators.
Furthermore, even though there is a finite region where
the microwave cavity is inevitably overlapping with the mesa,
the Qi on the etched structure (pink data) match those on the
intrinsic Si reference (blue data), and are hence limited by
loss mechanisms associated to typical Dolan-style JJs, such
as TLFs in the junctions’ tunneling oxide, lift-off residues,
or TLFs in the native SiO2 or in the Si substrate58–60. The
combination of this with a minimal overlapping area of the
resonators with the mesa (Aoverlap ≈2µm×5µm) makes it difficult to estimate the residual losses potentially introduced by
the etching process itself and the overlap with the mesa. For
completeness, we conduct electromagnetic (EM) simulations
to demonstrate that our tapered etching approach can also be effective for other Ge/SiGe heterostructures that initially exhibit
even higher microwave losses, with the simulated Qi showing
significant dependence on the overlap area (See Appendix D).
In this work, we also characterize JJ array resonators in the
presence of an in-plane magnetic field B∥up to 60 mT, applied
parallel to the JJ arrays’ axis (see Fig. 1e). Such magnetic field
range is compatible with the operation of spin qubits in planar
Ge5,12,61. Figure 3a shows the spectroscopy measurement of
the five notch resonators on the intrinsic Si substrate as a function of B∥, where fr of each resonator is effectively tuned in
a wide range of 7−4GHz in a span of B∥< 60mT. For magnetic fields above 60 mT the resonance frequencies are below
the measurement bandwidth (see Appendix B). The observed
modulation of fr is due to an effective variation of LJJ, which
can be attributed to the interplay of two different effects: (a) the
reduction of the superconducting gap of Al with an increasing
external magnetic field, and (b) the penetration of B∥inside
the junctions, generating a magnetic flux that modulates their
critical current62,63. An analytical model for fr(B∥) and a fit of
the experimental data is provided in Appendix H, where we
extract the junctions’ in-plane critical field to be approximately
B∥
crit ≈66mT.
Furthermore, we characterize the Qi of the resonators as
a function of B∥in steps of 5mT by performing resonator
spectroscopy as a function of the microwave drive power Pd in
the low-photon-number regime (⟨Nph⟩< 1). Figure 3b shows
the average Qi of each resonator in the low-photon-number
regime (blue data points) as a function of B∥, while the red
data points represent the Qi averaged over the five resonators.
Some resonators exhibit a strong reduction in Qi for specific
values of B∥(see for example the data point indicated by the
black arrow in Fig. 3b), which we attribute to some TLFs in
the junctions’ tunneling barrier becoming resonant with the
resonator mode and strongly coupling to it29,58,59. We report
such an example in Appendix I. We observe an overall trend of
decreasing Qi with increasing B∥, which can be attributed to an
increased quasiparticle population due to the superconducting
gap reduction as B∥approaches the critical field of the JJ Al
leads36,37, or to the creation of vortices in the proximity of the
resonators38. Nevertheless, the average Qi stays above 5000
for magnetic fields up to 40mT.
To further probe the limit of the photon loss rates of resonators on the etched Ge/SiGe heterostructure, we also char200 μm

acterize quarter-wave 50ΩNb CPW resonators. Moreover,
such 50Ωsuperconducting resonators are relevant for various
cQED architectures, including for instance superconducting
qubits33 and Andreev spin qubits18,26,27 systems, which do not
necessitate large fluctuations of the vacuum electric field in
the resonator to approach the strong coupling regime. As illustrated in Fig. 4a,b, we fabricate three lift-off 50 nm-thick CPW
Nb resonators with different lengths inductively coupled to the
same 50Ωphoton feedline in a notch configuration. The same
resonators are fabricated both on the etched heterostructure
and on the intrinsic Si substrate. See Appendix A.4 for details
about the fabrication. Differently from the JJ array resonators,
the CPW resonators on the etched heterostructure presented
here do not climb any mesa island, providing an upper limit
for the Qi on an etched surface and with a lift-off fabrication
method.
Figure 4c reports Qi as a function of ⟨Nph⟩for the resonators
on the etched heterostructure (purple dots) and on the intrinsic
Si substrate (orange dots). To extract Qi shown in Fig. 4c, we
perform spectroscopy of each resonator as a function of Pd, and
numerically fit to a linear input-output model for each value
of Pd. We note that the absence of non-linearity of the CPW
resonators facilitates the numerical fit to the linear model up
to ⟨Nph⟩≫1, as opposed to the case of JJ array resonators

(Fig. 2l), where the fit to the linear model was limited to the
range ⟨Nph⟩< 1. In Fig. 4c, we observe Qi ≈100000 for
⟨Nph⟩≈1 for both substrates, which is about two orders of
magnitude larger than the Qi obtained for similar resonators
defined directly on top of the Ge/SiGe heterostructure34. The
presented internal quality factors increase to Qi ≈400000
for ⟨Nph⟩≫1, implying TLF-dominated losses, most likely
due to the native SiO2 and NbOx45,57. Here, the extracted
similar values of Qi on the etched heterostructure and on the
intrinsic Si clearly indicate that the etching process itself does
not introduce additional loss channels for CPW resonators.
In conclusion, in this work we perform a tapered etching of a Ge/SiGe heterostructure down to its starting intrinsic Si substrate and characterize high-impedance (Zr = 3kΩ)
Al/AlOx/Al JJ array resonators and 50ΩNb CPW resonators
fabricated on the etched surface. While the characterized
JJ array resonators on the bare heterostructure exhibit Qi ≈
3000−4000 in the low-photon regime, mainly due to the defects residing in various layers of the heterostructure14, we
find that the etching of the heterostructure down to the the Si
substrate significantly enhances the internal quality factor up to
Qi ≈10000−20000. We show that both the etching process
itself and the small overlapping region with the mesa do not
introduce notable losses. We further demonstrate Qi ≈100000
for the 50ΩNb resonators, confirming that the extracted Qi of
the JJ array resonators are limited by the JJ fabrication process.
In addition, we demonstrate the resonance frequency tunability
of the JJ array resonators in a wide range of 7 −4GHz by
means of an in-plane magnetic field up to 60mT, preserving
Qi above 5000 below 40mT. These magnetic fields are compatible with the operation of spin qubits on planar Ge5,12,61.
While we mainly focus on the resonators defined on a
Ge/SiGe heterostructure, which is a promising platform for
various hybrid quantum systems including hole QDs29,31,
ABSs16–18 and minimal Kitaev chains19, the presented tapered etching technique is a versatile approach for any kind of
heterostructure comprising defects located at different layers.
Therefore, our work provides a path toward highly coherent
light-matter interface in semiconductor heterostructures.

Appendix A: Fabrication methods
A.1.
Heterostructure growth
The Ge/SiGe heterostructure shown in Fig. 1a is grown
via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by adopting a reversegrading approach as described in ref34. The full stack is ≈
1.6µm thick, grown on a 280 µm thick intrinsic Si wafer with a
resistivity > 10kΩ·cm. The 16nm-thick QW is buried below
≈60nm of SiGe spacer, terminated by ≈2nm of Si cap, fully
oxidized by an additional oxygen plasma treatment ex-situ just
before starting the fabrication process.
A.2.
Tapered heterostructure etching
To perform the tapered Ge/SiGe heterostructure etching, the
sample is spin-coated with 2 µm of positive-tone photoresist
AZ10XT-20. The etching mask is patterned with photolithography using a 405 nm direct laser writer. In order to provide the
mesa step with a tapered profile, the sample is baked at 135 ◦C
for 2 minutes: in this way, the resist reflows and its sidewalls
acquire a rounded profile, which imprints a tapered edge to
the heterostructure during the etching. The heterostructure is
etched using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) dry etching
process using Cl2 chemistry. During the etching process, the
chamber is at a pressure of 5 mTorr, the Cl2 gas flow is kept
at 50 sccm, the RF power to generate the plasma is 800 W and
the RF power to accelerate the ions and control their mean
energy is 100 W. A laser-based end point detection system
reveals when the Si substrate is reached and is used to stop
the etching process without excessively over-etching the Si

is rapidly neutralized from Cl2 in H2O, and the etching mask
stripped in a solution of 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) at
70 ◦C for a couple of hours.

Josephson junction array resonators
The fabrication of the Josephson junction array resonators
consists of two steps: (a) Nb ground plane deposition and (b)
Al-AlOx-Al Josephson junction deposition.
The ground plane is patterned using photolithography and
lift-off; the sample is spin-coated with 400 nm of negativetone resist LOR 5A followed by 1.1 µm of positive-tone resist
AZ 1512 HS and patterned using a 405 nm direct laser writer.
30 nm of Nb are deposited in a Plassys UHV e-beam evaporator
at a rate of 0.5 nm/s. Without breaking the vacuum, Nb is
oxidized statically at a pressure of 10 torr for 10 minutes to
provide a first clean oxidized interface. Nb is lifted off in an
NMP solution at 70 ◦C for a couple of hours.
To pattern the Dolan-style JJ array resonators the sample
is spin-coated with 400 nm of MMA followed by 220 nm of
PMMA. The resonator body and the junctions’ suspended
bridges are patterned with 100 keV electron-beam lithography.
The junctions are deposited in a Plassys UHV e-beam evaporator; a first layer of 35 nm of Al is deposited with an angle
of +45◦at a rate of 0.5 nm/s. Without breaking the vacuum,
the sample is oxidized statically at a pressure of 2 torr for 20
minutes. A second layer of 130 nm of Al is deposited with
an angle of −45◦at a rate of 0.5 nm/s. Finally, the sample
is oxidized again at a pressure of 10 torr for 10 minutes to
provide a first clean oxidized interface. Al is lifted off in an
NMP solution at 70 ◦C for a couple of hours.
A.4.
CPW Nb resonators
The CPW Nb resonators are patterned using photolithography and lift-off. The sample is spin-coated with 400 nm of
LOR 5A resist followed by 1.1 µm of AZ 1512 HS resist and
patterned using a 405 nm direct laser writer. 50 nm of Nb are
deposited in a Plassys UHV e-beam evaporator at a rate of
1 nm/s. The sample is taken out of the evaporator, oxidized in
air and lifted off in an NMP solution at 70 ◦C for a couple of
hours.
Appendix B: Measurement setup
The measurements reported in this work are performed in a
dilution refrigerator (Bluefors LD400) equipped with a 6-1-1
Tesla vector magnet (American Magnetics), at base temperatures around 10 mK. The devices are mounted on a printed
circuit board (PCB) hosting RF transmission lines with a characteristic impedance of Z0 = 50Ω. The transmission lines are
wire-bonded to the on-chip photon feedlines on one end, and
directly connected to coaxial cables for RF signals on the other
end. Resonator spectroscopy is performed with a vector network analyzer (VNA, Rohde & Schwarz ZNB20). The VNA
output is attenuated by 20 dB at room temperature, followed
by a DC block (Inmet 8039 inner-outer). The signal is then
attenuated at various stages in the cryostat with a total attenuation of 60 dB. In addition, from previous line calibration
measurements we estimated an additional attenuation of the
signal by ≈10dB before reaching the device, due to cable
losses. The signal transmitted through the device then passes
through two isolators (Low Noise Factory ISISC4_8A) and
two circulators (Low Noise Factory CICIC4_8A). The signal
is amplified by a HEMT at the 4 K stage (Low Noise Factory
LNC4_8C) and by a low noise amplifier at room temperature
(Agile AMT A0284) after passing through another dc block
(Inmet 8039).

Josephson junction array resonators
From room temperature resistance measurements of junction
test structures, we extract a resistance per JJ of RJJ ≈1.25kΩ,
corresponding to an inductance per junction of LJJ ≈1.48nH,
a critical current of Ic,JJ ≈220nA and a Josephson energy
EJ ≈111GHz. From SEM measurements, we get a JJ area
of w×l = 520nm×760nm; assuming a thickness tox ≈1nm

===== Page 8 =====

for the oxide tunneling barrier, we compute the junction’s selfcapacitance CJ ≈31.5fF, corresponding to a charging energy
EC ≈0.6GHz. We obtain a ratio EJ/EC ≈180 and a plasma
frequency ωp ≈23GHz.
With a 40µm spacing of the JJ array resonator to the ground
plane, we estimate a capacitance per unit length to ground of
C0,Si ≈0.057fF/µm (C0,SiGe ≈0.061fF/µm) on the Si (SiGe
heterostructure) substrate64. The difference in capacitance
originates from the difference in dielectric constant of the two
substrates, respectively assumed to be 11.9 and 13.0. Concerning the central JJ array resonator of the five, we concatenate
N = 46 junctions. We take into account the aforementioned
junctions, as well as the extra spurious junctions originated
by the Dolan-bridge technique (≈3.5µm long, hence contributing much less to the total inductance), and we obtain a
total inductance of the array Ltot ≈78.9nH and a total length
of 207µm. We treat the resonator as a distributed element65.
By grounding one resonator’s side while keeping the other
end open (see Fig.1e), we define a quarter-wave fundamental
mode, with a lumped equivalent inductance of Leq ≈67nH
and capacitance Ceq,Si ≈5.78fF (Ceq,SiGe ≈6.27fF)64. These
values result in a bare resonance frequency of fSi ≈8.09GHz
(fSiGe ≈7.77GHz).
We add the coupling hook shown in Fig.1e (green color) to
determine the external coupling rate κc to the photon feedline.
For the resonators on the bare SiGe heterostructure we design
a coupling hook that is longer than on Si (100µm-long vs
40µm-long), in order to provide a higher coupling rate. At
the voltage anti-node of the resonator we add the 150µm ×
150µm mesa island, together with a 2µm × 10µm patch of
the resonator end that climbs over the mesa step (see Fig.1f),
overlapping with the mesa with an area of Aoverlap = 2µm ×
5µm. As explained in the main text, this patch is realized in
the same evaporation step of the JJs, therefore its inductance
can be neglected. Although the resonators on intrinsic Si and
on SiGe do not need to climb any mesa, we also design them
with a patch a the voltage antinode with the same dimensions,
in order to compare resonators with the same design.
With this JJ array resonator design, we perform electromagnetic (EM) simulations (Sonnet software) to properly estimate
both the coupling quality factor and the loaded resonance frequency. The simulation setup is shown in Fig.5. To do so,
we replace the JJ array with a strip of the same length and
width, and with a sheet inductance of L□≈208pH/□. At this
simulation stage, the substrate losses that we provide in the
simulation software can be arbitrarily chosen. Finally, we fit
the simulation results to Eq. E6 and we extract a resonance
frequency of fSi ≈7.02GHz (fSiGe ≈6.61GHz) and a coupling quality factor of Qc,Si ≈1000 (Qc,SiGe ≈600). From
the simulated resonance frequency we extract the total Ceq,
keeping the same Leq previously computed. This allows us to
estimate an equivalent impedance of the resonator Zeq = 3kΩ
for both substrates. In conclusion, to design the remaining four
resonators hanged to the same transmission line, we just sweep
the total number of junctions from N = 42 to N = 50 to effectively get a frequency spacing of ≈200MHz between each
resonator. For EM simulations that take into account the losses
originating from the mesa climb on the etched heterostructure,
see Appendix D.
C.2.
50 ΩCPW resonators
For the Nb CPW resonators we follow a standard resonator
design, where the resonance frequency and impedance depend both on geometric parameters only. The inner conductor
is 16 µm wide and the gap between the inner conductor and
the ground plane is 10 µm wide, resulting in a characteristic
impedance of 50 Ωon a Si substrate. The length of the resonators is adjusted to target resonance frequencies of 5−6GHz.
The resonators are open on one side and shunted to the ground
plane on the other side, in a quarter-wave geometry. The very
high coupling quality factors Qc ≈100000 are achieved just
by placing the current anti-node of the resonator few µm far
away from the feedline, as shown in Fig.4b.
Appendix D: Electromagnetic simulations for losses estimations
To further validate the efficacy of our tapered etching approach, we perform electromagnetic (EM) simulations using
Sonnet®. As outlined in the main text, the primary source of
loss in reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructures originates at
the lattice-mismatched interface between the initial Si wafer
and the Ge virtual substrate. Moreover, as discussed in ref34,
the independence of the Qi on ⟨Nph⟩suggests that the loss
mechanism cannot be saturated with the power. For this reason, we treat microwave losses as resistive losses as a result of the coupling of the resonator to a conductive layer
buried at the interface between the Si substrate and the Ge
virtual substrate.
We define this layer 100nm thick and
encapsulate it between the intrinsic (conductivity at 10mK:
σ = 4.4×10−7 S/m) Si substrate (dielectric losses: loss tangent tanδ = 1.0×10−5) and a 1.5 µm thick intrinsic (conductivity at 10mK: σ = 4.4×10−7 S/m) SiGe spacer (dielectric
losses: loss tangent tanδ = 1.0×10−5). The total thickness of
the full stack is 1.6µm, as shown in Fig.5. The assumption of
identical losses for both the Si substrate and the SiGe spacer is
unrealistic, given the presence of TLFs in the SiGe heterostructure. However, as the predominant losses arise from the 100
nm lattice-mismatched layer, a precise quantification of the
TLF losses in the SiGe layer falls beyond the scope of this
work. Please note that the thickness of 100nm is completely
arbitrary: it represents just a way to confine the losses to a
buried layer not in direct galvanic contact with the resonator.
On the other hand, a loss tangent tanδ = 1.0×10−5 establishes
a more realistic upper bound for Qi ≈100000. Without appropriate surface treatment to remove surface contaminants and
native SiO2, achieving larger Qi would not be feasible in the
low photon regime, even for simple 50ΩNb resonators. In
fact, such aggressive surface treatments are typically avoided
in QW-based semiconductor devices.
In all the simulation results shown in this section, the object
of the study is the same resonator described in Appendix C.1.
In the first set of simulations, shown in Fig. 6a, we study
Qi as a function of the conductivity σ of the 100nm lattice-

mismatched layer. We sweep σ by five orders of magnitude,
from 0.001S/m to 10S/m, corresponding to a resistivity ρ
varying from 100kΩ·cm to 10Ω·cm. Fig. 6a reports the
resulting Qi as a function of σ in two different cases. In
the first case (green dots), the resonator lies on top of the
full heterostructure, while in the second case (pink dots) the
body of the resonator lies on top of the Si substrate, and
climbs a 150µm×150µm mesa only with an overlap area of
Aoverlap = 2µm×5µm, exactly as in the case of the fabricated
and characterized devices. With respect to the bare heterostructure case, the simulation predicts an increase of about one
order of magnitude in Qi for σ ≥0.1S/m with our etching
approach. This suggests that the proposed tapered etching approach can also be efficient for resonators directly fabricated
on Ge/SiGe heterostructures which present Qi < 1000. We
note that the case σ = 0.1S/m predicts Qi ≈4000 on the bare
heterostructure, and Qi ≈30000 on the etched one. This scenario may reproduce our experimental data for the JJ array
resonator case. Unfortunately, as discussed in the main text,
the quality of the JJ fabrication does not allow us to observe
Qi beyond 10000−20000.
In the second simulation, whose results are reported in Fig.
6b, we fix σ = 0.1S/m and sweep the area of the overlap
region from 0 to 2µm×30µm. Within this interval, we notice
a drop in Qi by one order of magnitude (from ≈100000 to
≈10000), which underlines the importance of keeping the
overlap area as small as possible in order to minimize the
losses.
Appendix E: Resonator fitting models

Linear model
The experimental spectroscopy data S21(fd) is fitted to a
master equation model. For the JJ array resonators in the
low-photon regime and for the CPW resonators at any photon
number, we describe the resonators with a linear Hamiltonian:
H = ¯hω0a†a.

If we add to this simple model the presence of a non-ideal

S21 = aeiαe−iωdτ 2i∆r +κL −κceiφ0/cos(φ0)

(E6)
where we have defined the loaded quality factor κL = κi +κc
and a, α, τ and φ0 are correction factors to take into account
the non-ideal response of the cavity due to the environment.

To fit the full power sweep spectroscopy data of JJ array resonators like the one represented in Fig. 2d, we first perform a
linear fit of single power slices of the data to Eq. E6 below the
single photon power, in order to extract the parameters ω0, κc,
κi and the environmental parameters. We then fit the whole 2D
data of the power sweep spectroscopy to Eq. E9, optimizing
only the values of K and φ while keeping the values of ωd,
κc and κi fixed to the values obtained from the linear fit. We
operate in this way because at high photon number the fitting
procedure typically struggles to properly extract all the fitting
parameters independently, and our goal for the nonlinear fit is
to estimate the self-Kerr nonlinearity K.
Appendix F: Power spectroscopies for all resonators
Figure 7 shows power spectroscopy measurements for all
resonators. By fitting these power scans to Eq. E6 in the lowphoton-number regime, we obtain the internal quality factors
shown in Figs. 2l, 4c. We note that for some resonators it
is possible to observe the strong hybridization, and the corresponding resonance splitting, of the resonators with TLFs
that reside in the junctions’ oxide tunneling barriers (see for
instance Figs. 7d, l, m). By fitting the full power sweeps of
the JJ arrays to the nonlinear model in Eq. E9, we consistently
find Kerr nonlinearities in the range K ≈100kHz −300kHz.
These values are consistent with an approximate theoretical
estimate of the JJ array’s nonlinearity: for a single JJ, indeed,
K1 = EC ≈600MHz20 (see Appendix C.1); given that the Kerr
nonlinearity scales55 with the number of junctions N approximately as KN ∝1/N2, we obtain KN ≈EC/N2 ≈280kHz for
N = 46.
Appendix G: Extracted coupling quality factors
In Fig.8 (Fig.9) we report the extracted coupling quality
factors Qc of the JJ array (the Nb 50Ω) resonators. Qc is
≈1000−2000 for the JJ array resonators on the Si reference
and on the etched heterostructure, and ≈600 for the ones on
top of the bare heterostructure, matching the simulated ones
(see Appendix C.1). For the 50Ωresonators, we extract Qc
of 100000−200000, also in this case perfectly matching the
simulated ones (see Appendix C.2).
Appendix H: In-plane magnetic field dependence of JJ arrays’
resonance frequencies
The resonance frequency of Josephson junction array resonators depends on the presence of an external magnetic field.

In this work, we investigated this behavior in the presence of
an in-plane magnetic field B∥applied parallel to the JJ array’s
axis. The dependence of the resonance frequency fr on B∥is
due to the interplay of two effects. Firstly, an external magnetic
field reduces the superconducting gap of the Al leads of the JJs

if d ≪ℓ(and hence ℓcan be replaced with d) and d ≪ξ0.
For the Josephson junctions of this work, we use standard Al
parameters62 λL ≈16nm, ξ0 ≈1600nm and Bbulk
crit ≈10mT
and predict λeff,1 ≈129nm and B∥
crit,1 ≈254mT for the bottom Al layer (d1 = 35nm/

B∥
crit,2 ≈36mT for the top Al layer (d2 = 130nm/

We expect the actual critical field to be dominated by the minimum between B∥
crit,1 and B∥
crit,2, hence B∥
crit ≈36mT.
Eq. H1 translates into a magnetic-field dependent critical
current Ic = π∆(B∥)/(2RN), where RN is the normal-state resistance of the junction, which in turn translates into a magneticfield dependent junction inductance LJ = Φ0/(2πIc). Finally,
the resonance frequency of the JJ array resonators depends on

In addition to that, an in-plane magnetic field can thread the

A = w(λ1 +tox +λ2),

where λ1,2 = min(λeff,1,2, d1,2) is the actual portion of the Al

a magnetic flux that modulates the critical current of the JJ.

routine between these two fitting parameters, which hinders a
reliable independent extraction of both parameters at the same
time; to mitigate this problem, it would be helpful to collect
spectroscopy data at magnetic fields much closer to B∥
crit or
to BΦ0, where the functional dependence of fr(B∥) allows to
better fit the two parameters independently. Unfortunately,
for the devices presented in this work the frequency of the
resonators falls outside of our measurement bandwidth for
B∥> 60mT. In addition to this, experimental data can deviate
from the theoretical prediction presented above in the presence
of two films of different thicknesses and for very thin films62,
so that Eqs. H2, and H3 remain true only qualitatively. Lastly,
small deviations of the thicknesses of the Al leads from the
values reported here are possible due to the fabrication process.
However, estimating B∥
crit and BΦ0 with a higher precision is
beyond the scope of this work.
Appendix I: Strong coupling of JJ array resonators with TLFs
The oxide tunneling barrier of JJs can host defects that
behave as TLFs29,58,59, whose frequency can happen to fall in
the GHz range. If the frequency of a JJ array resonator comes
in resonance with the frequency of a TLF, due to the strong
electric field in the resonator the two systems can couple and in
the resonator spectroscopy it is possible to observe a splitting
of the resonator’s frequency. Figure 12 shows an example
of such phenomenon for the resonators on the intrinsic Si
substrate indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 3b. In Fig. 12a,

FIG. 12. Spectroscopy of the JJ resonator on the intrinsic Si substrate
indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 3b. (a) is taken at zero external
magnetic field, while (b) at B∥= 10mT. Circular blue points represent the measured data, while the continuous dark line represents
a fit to Eq. E6. In (a), only the resonator’s resonance dip is visible.
In (b) the resonator’s frequency, lowered by the external magnetic
field, comes in resonance with a TLF residing in the oxide tunneling
barrier of the JJs, and couples with it, resulting in a double and less
deep resonance dip. As a consequence, the fit extracts a lower internal
quality factor, as indicated in Fig. 3b.
at B∥= 0T, one single resonance is visible as the resonator
does not hybridize with TLFs at this frequency. However, as
we apply B∥= 10mT and lower the resonator’s frequency, the
latter comes in resonance with a TLF and observe a double
resonance as shown in Fig. 12b.
