Abstract. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a semiconductor used in quantum information processing, microelectromechanical systems, photonics, power electronics, and harsh environment sensors. However,
its high temperature stability, high breakdown voltage, wide bandgap, and high mechanical strength
are accompanied by a chemical inertness which makes complex micromachining difficult. Photoelectrochemical etching is a simple, rapid means of wet processing SiC, including the use of dopant
selective etch stops that take advantage of mature SiC homoepitaxy. However, dopant selective
photoelectrochemical etching typically relies on highly doped material, which poses challenges for
device applications such as quantum defects and photonics that benefit from low doping to produce
robust emitter properties and high optical transparency. In this work, we develop a new, selective
photoelectrochemical etching process that relies not on high doping but on the electrical depletion
of a fabricated diode structure, allowing the selective etching of an n-doped substrate wafer versus
an undoped epitaxial (Na = 1(10)14cm−3) device layer. We characterize the photo-response and
photoelectrochemical etching behavior of the diode under bias and use those insights to suspend
large (> 100µm2) undoped membranes of SiC. We further characterize the compatibility of membranes with quantum emitters, performing comparative spin spectroscopy between undoped and
highly doped membrane structures, finding the use of undoped material improves ensemble spin
lifetime by > 3x. This work enables the fabrication of high-purity suspended thin films suitable for
scalable photonics, mechanics, and quantum technologies in SiC.
1. Introduction
A high-yield, systematic means of producing high-quality thin-films is an outstanding challenge in
realizing scalable quantum and classical technology. The availability of single crystal thin films with
high purity and optical quality has led to large advances in miniaturizing typically bulk optical components with equivalent integrated photonic devices and the development of micro-electromechanical
circuits.[1–4] One such approach to creating thin films in semiconductor materials with effective p
and n-type doping, is dopant selective photoelectrochemical (PEC) or electrochemical etching of one

doping type over the other in an epitaxial or implanted homojunction.[5] Such etching strategies have
been designed in silicon, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide, and silicon carbide homojunctions.[6–9]
However, these approaches rely on heavily doped device layers, as lowering the doping of the device
layer reduces etching selectivity.[9] A dopant selective electrochemical etch that does not require
high device layer doping is desirable in applications where high doping degrades performance or design flexibility, such as electronics, photonics, and mechanics or in material systems where effective
doping is not available for either p-type or n-type, such as zinc oxide or diamond respectively.[10–13]
This work presents such a process, with a particular application to Silicon Carbide (SiC), a wide
band-gap semiconductor widely studied for use in photonics, mechanics, and quantum information[14–17]. Consequently, SiC is such a material that could benefit from a PEC etching process
that results in a low doped thin film. For example, SiC hosts several solid-state quantum defect
qubits which show lifetime limited optical linewidths, long spin coherence, and high initialization
fidelity which could form the basis of quantum memory nodes in a quantum network.[18, 19] Dopantselective PEC has successfully created suspended photonics in SiC with integrated defects, yet these
devices and defects demonstrate degraded optical and spin performance, respectively due to the
required use of high doping concentration.[20–22] This requirement is predicated on the ability to
independently control band bending in each material doping type with respect to the chemical
potential of decomposition in the etching electrolyte, which is more favorable in layers with large
differences in doping.[23]
We present a modified PEC process, that uses the bias of a simple transparent Shottky barrier
diode to enable independent electrochemical control of each material layer.
We show selective
etching between an undoped layer of 4H-SiC and a highly doped substrate, demonstrating high
etch rates (> 4µm/hr), low surface roughness (∼1nm RMS), and large areas (> 100µm2) of
undercut material. We further demonstrate the immediate device performance advantages of this
process over a process that relies high doping of the device layer alone, comparing the quantum spin
performance of ensembles of silicon monovacancies in doped and undoped layers . When an undoped
layer is used, lower strain, longer spin coherence, and lower inhomogeneous broadening is observed.
The reliance of this technique on an externally fabricated diode device rather than solely on material
properties indicates that this technique could be adapted to other material systems where junctions
can be fabricated.

2. Main
Due to its highly chemically inert nature, suspended SiC photonic and mechanical devices are often created using SmartCut, grind-and-polish, deep backside etching, or via dopant selective photoelectro-chemical etching (PEC).[2, 24–27] These techniques have enabled fabrication of high-quality
devices, but performance is typically limited by wafer non-uniformity, yield, excess strain and charge
noise. PEC usually relies on high doping contrast between epitaxial layers to selectively etch, for
example, a highly n-doped substrate from a comparably p-doped epilayer, with the epilayer as the
ultimate host of both photonic devices and quantum defects. However, free carrier absorption from
highly doped material and charge noise creates optical propagation loss and limits qubit spin coherence.[22] Previously fabricated devices demonstrated high quality optical resonances, but suffered
from high strain, roughened surfaces and poor defect coherence.[22, 28]

The photoelectrochemical etching of single crystal SiC is well understood for both n and p doping
types in alkaline solutions. In both cases, etching occurs through the elimination of silicon through
the formation of a soluble silicate product and carbon monoxide via the charge exchange of holes
with hydroxide ions in solution[29]:
(1)
SiC + 8OH−+ 6h+ →[Si(OH)2O2]2−+ CO + 3H2O
In p-type material, electrochemical etching can occur without illumination, because holes are a
majority carrier in the material.[30] Because the valence band in p-type material typically bends
in energy downwards towards the chemical potential of the electrolyte, the onset of etching occurs
when the cell bias lowers the barrier holes experience in reaching this interface. By contrast, in
n-type material, etching does not occur unless the SiC is illuminated to generate the requisite holes,
and though the onset of etching can occur without cell bias, it is often beneficially controlled by the
application of such a bias.[29] Etching rate is limited by the rate of reaction at the semiconductorelectrolyte interface, controlled by the quantity and diffusion rate of ions in solution and holes in
the semiconductor towards the interface. The diffusion rate of ions to the interface is controlled
by mass transport in the bulk of the solution and the potential drop that ions experience at the
Helmholtz double layer. In the semiconductor, the diffusion of holes to the interface is controlled
by the built-in voltage of the semiconductor-electrolyte junction and the voltage difference between
the semiconductor (working) electrode and the counter electrode. The number of holes is largely
determined by the intensity of illumination. Photoelectrochemical etching of silicon carbide is stable
if anodic oxidation does not outpace the dissolution by charge exchange, in which case the etch
is passivated by an insulating layer of SiO2.[29] Additionally, the etching rate can be controlled
by crystallography. In hexagonal polytypes of SiC, the carbon-face of the material is known to be
significantly more reactive than the silicon-face of the material and consequently has a significantly
faster PEC etch.[31] p-type (n-type) material may be selectively etched against relatively n-type
(p-type) material by appropriate selection of cell bias by setting a more negative (positive) cell bias
which fixes the energy position of the valence band relative to the electrolyte‘s chemical potential,
potentially yielding suspended structures if the substrate is targetted in the etch (Figure 1a-b).
In a homojunction that combines both doping types this relies on a high doping difference (e.g.
Na = 1(10)14cm−3 vs.
Nd = 1(10)14cm−3) and allows a 0.5V potential window for selectively
etching relatively thick layers of SiC.[23]

Unfortunately, in addition to the constraints on applications imposed by the high doping spread
necessary for selective etching, doping selectivity in a homojunction depends on the ability to mutually bias both doping types in the cell. While this assumption is reasonable in thick layers or under
low illumination conditions, it breaks down in epilayer thicknesses approaching useful thicknesses
in photonic devices because of strong photo-biasing of the homojunction. To assess this effect, we
construct a junction from a thin, 500nm undoped layer of 4H-SiC epitaxially deposited onto an
n-type (3(10)18 nitrogen doped) substrate wafer. Contact is made to the n-type substrate by thermally evaporating 200nm of nickel on the substrate backside followed by subsequent rapid thermal
annealing for 5 minutes at 950◦C in an argon atmosphere. Contact is made to the unintentional
doped layer by thermally evaporating 200nm of aluminum onto the epilayer, with a circular aperture
in the center of the sample left masked. The mask is then stripped, and contact is made by rapid
thermal annealing for 5 minutes at 950◦C in an argon atmosphere. The sample is then immersed

where CSC is the capacitance of the space charge region, ϵ0 and ϵr are the vacuum and relative (9.6
for 4H-SiC) permittivities, Na,d is the acceptor or donor concentration, respectively. e is the electron
charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. By linear fitting
to the slope of the measured capacitance in cathodic and anodic sweeps, it is possible to determine
the acceptor and donor concentrations, respectively. The net doping is found to be 1.15(10)14cm−3,
as shown in Figure 1c, hereafter referred to as the "p-type" layer.
For PEC-enabled release of etched structures, indium tin oxide (ITO) is adopted as an optically
transparent contact to the p-type layer through which the underlying SiC can be illuminated while
still providing uniform electrical connectivity across the cell.
For diode characterization, cyclic
voltammetry, and PEC etching, ITO is sputtered at a rate of 3nm/min to form a 100nm layer,
ramping the substrate to 600◦C over the course of deposition.
Substrate heating was found to
be necessary to form a suitably conductive contact to the p-type epilayer.
Illumination for all
measurements and etching is provided by a 500W Xe-Hg Arc lamp with its visible spectrum filtered
by a 400nm short-pass filter to reduce excess heating of the sample, producing a peak intensity
of 1W ˙cm−2. Before fabricating membrane devices we first characterize the photo-response of the
diode structure, to determine the degree to which the epilayer is photo-biased as the lamp intensity
is varied.
In the dark, the current-voltage (IV) curve shows a turn-on voltage of 0.5V .
Under
increasing illumination, the diode shows a typical photodiode response, with a peak photo-bias of
490mV measured at a lamp intensity of 1W ˙cm−2 (Figure 1e).
To characterize the dopant-selective undercut process, mesas are first defined by patterning the
ITO layer using positive tone (PMMA495 C6) electron-beam lithography. The pattern is transferred
to the ITO by inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching in H2/CF4, and then subsequently
transferred into the SiC to a depth of 2µm using dry etching in SF6/O2. ITO is found to be a highly
selective hard mask, as oxide reduction is continually countered by plasma oxidation via the oxygen
present in the SiC etching gas mixture, yielding a selectivity of 50:1. PEC etching is performed

in 40 −500mM potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte which is continuously circulated from a
10◦C reservoir to ensure a constant electrolyte concentration and to extract waste heat, with no
supporting electrolyte added. The counter electrode is a wound Pt wire and the reference electrode
is an Ag/AgCl electrode in 3M KCl. The membranes are undercut using a PEC cell, with two
separate electrical circuits present. The first is the potentiostat, used to bias either the n-type or
p-type SiC as a working electrode against the Pt counter electrode. The second is the junction bias,
controlled by attaching a voltage source to the p-type and n-type contacts. To assess the impact of
photo-biasing on the etching kinetics of the junction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) is performed under
various junction bias conditions with a sweep rate of 20mV s−1 (Figure 2a). Under full-illumination
(1W ˙cm−2) and no external bias applied to the junction, the p-type and n-type CV curves recorded
are similar except that the p-type curve is shifted anodic relative to the n-type curve (Figure 2a.i).
This is contrary to rigorous studies of thick layers of 4H-SiC which found that n-type curves should
be anodic relative to p-type curves.[23] Furthermore, no distinct oxidation or reduction peaks are
observed corresponding to p-type or n-type etching, confirming that the strong photo-biasing of the
cell has eliminated etch selectivity. However, by noting that the photo-biasing occurs because of
the presence of the junction formed by the epilayer and substrate, it can be concluded that the
photo-biasing can be completely suppressed by reverse biasing the junction to correct for the photogenerated voltage. By closing the junction circuit between the ITO and Ni junction contacts, the CV
curves converge (Figure 2a.ii). While closing the junction circuit may restore selectivity in highly
doped material, we must further increase the junction bias in our case of an undoped epilayer. The
junction bias depletes the epilayer of carriers and creates selectivity between regions of different
doping where it is not possible to achieve rapid selective etching without diode biasing. As greater
reverse bias is progressively applied, the quasi-Fermi level in the valence band of the p-type layer
rises relative to that in the n-type layer and the dissolution potential into the electrolyte, and the
p-type CV curve shifts cathodic (Figure 2a.iii-v). At the same time, the characteristic oxidation and
reduction peaks associated with controlled etching reappear, now at cell biases significantly different
enough to support selective etching.
To assess doping selectivity in realistic structures, a series of 4µm wide mesas are undercut in
40mM and 200mM KOH at different junction reverse biases (Figure 2), with a cell bias of 0.2V ,
selected to ensure that the n-type electrode is not passivated.[29] Lateral etching rates and membrane
morphology are determined using focused-ion-beam (FIB) cross sectioning.
In both electrolyte

concentrations, as the reverse bias increases, p-type etching is suppressed before becoming fully
passivated, past a reverse bias of −1.3V (Figure 2b). Cross sectional images corroborate this finding,
showing partial undercutting of the p-type layer at moderate reverse biases (−0.75V ), and full
passivation at high reverse biases(−1.5V ) (Figure 2c). This result demonstrates that at sufficient
reverse bias, diffusion of photo-generated carriers can be predominantly controlled not by differences
in doping but by external biasing.
Smoothly-etched surfaces are highly desirable for photonic and mechanical structures, as scattering loss and surface damping are therefore reduced. We investigate the impact that electrolyte
concentration has on the surface roughness of the underside of our membranes. The membranes
shown in Figure 2c are fully suspended and then lifted out using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
stamping (Figure 3a). The surface roughness of the membrane underside is then measured by tapping mode atomic force microscopy. We find that the concentration of electrolyte strongly controls
the surface quality of the underside of the membranes, with lower concentration (40mM KOH)
yielding a RMS surface roughness value of 1.43nm (Figure 3b-d), whereas higher concentrations of
KOH yield rougher surfaces (5.51nm for 500mM KOH). Previous work suggests that roughness increases in a regime where oxide formation exceeds the rate of oxide removal, indicating this balance
may be more difficult to establish at high electrolyte concentrations.[23] Similar work also showed
that above 500mM concentrations, only porous SiC is formed by PEC.[31]

To assess the potential for the material to host quantum spin registers, the reverse bias undercut
process is paired with spin resonance and spin lifetime measurements. A suspended, 500nm thick
undoped membrane formed using the process described, etched in 40mM KOH, is compared to
another,
500nm thick suspended membrane comprised of p-i-p-n (150nm p-type, 200nm undoped, 150nm
p-type, n-type substrate) material used in previous work, that is undercut under identical conditions.[28] Prior work found that slight shifts in the ZPL, ODMR and spin coherence times in
photoelectrochemical etched structures was a result of high doping, porosity and strain induced by
the PEC process.[22] We select the silicon monovacancy for study as it can be flexibly introduced
and has been shown to have high quality optical and spin properties in nanostructures.[33, 34] Each
sample is identically implanted with He ions of energy 45keV at a dose of 1011 ions · cm−2 followed
by quenching from 650◦C after annealing in air for 30 minutes, to form a weak ensemble of silicon monovacancies (V −
Si). The samples are then loaded into a 4K flow cryostat and fitted with a

microwave wire antenna to excite ground state spin resonances. The charge state of the defects is
initialized by an off resonant helium neon laser with a power of 3mW, probed by 28dbm of input RF
power, and photoluminescence is measured on the phonon sideband (>925nm) of the defects using
near resonant excitation with a 916nm external cavity diode laser with a power of 100µW.(Figure

To compare the spin performance of emitters in both the heavily doped and undoped material,
power dependent optically detected magnetic resonance
(ODMR), free induction decay times (T ∗
2 ), and spin dephasing times (T2) are measured for each
ensemble (Figure 4a). The ground state (S = 3/2) spin levels, which are typically separated by
a zero-field splitting of 70MHz are separated further by a moderate magnetic field of 60G to a
final splitting of 240MHz to reduce the effect of heteronuclear spin flip processes that limit the

2 transition, ODMR
studies in Figure 4b,c show similar performance, with emitters in both material types demonstrating
narrow inhomogeneous broadening that saturate to a minimum at similar drive powers. The T ∗
2
time of 1.64 ± 0.02µs measured in the undoped material (Figure 4d) is longer than that in the
doped material (Figure 4e), approaching the theoretically predicted low field limit of (1.9µs) for
monovacancy spins in a naturally abundant 29Si,13C nuclear bath.[35] This demonstrates that the
use of undoped material reduces the presence of influences that induce fast dephasing of the spins,
which previously limited PEC-etched device performance [22]. In contrast, the T2 time is similar
between the two samples, showing that in both cases on longer timescales the defects are limited by
similar slow, dephasing processes. This implies that doping or material defects, and not material
porosity or fabrication damage, primarily drives the degradation of V −
Si spin properties in PEC
processed material.
3. Conclusion
We have demonstrated a means of dopant-selective PEC etching that significantly relaxes constraints placed on doping density to achieve etch selectivity–thereby enabling the suspension of lowsurface roughness, large-area membranes with an improved charge-noise environment to host quantum emitters. This approach reduces the epitaxial steps necessary for high purity, PEC-suspended
photonics and mechanics in SiC to one step with the addition of a commonly used hard-mask (ITO)
and a circuit to bias the junction formed between the epilayer and substrate. We investigate the

photo-electrochemical attributes of SiC diodes under external biasing and show that smooth membranes of undoped silicon carbide can be suspended at rates exceeding 4um/hr. We additionally
note that the demonstrated 500nm device layer is defined by epitaxial growth and can therefore
be flexibly changed to suit application. Finally, we perform comparative spin spectroscopy on suspended doped and undoped materials, demonstrating that undoped material beneficially reduces the
effect of fast spin noise on quantum defects and is compatible with PEC processing. The development of a means of reliably suspending large undoped membranes of SiC opens up new opportunities
leveraging 4H-SiC’s high yield strength for nanomechanical oscillators and applications that integrate quantum emitters into electronic and photonic devices.[36] Beyond SiC, this technique relaxes
the material constraints for dopant selective etching, suggesting a means of selectively etching other
inert material where only a single doping type can be reliably created, such as diamond.
