Abstract 
Optical inspection has long served as a cornerstone non-destructive method in 
semiconductor wafer manufacturing, particularly for surface and defect analysis. 
However, conventional techniques such as bright-field and dark-field scattering optics 
face significant limitations, including insufficient resolution and the inability to penetrate 
and detect buried structures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), while offering higher 
resolution and precise surface characterization, is constrained by slow speed, limited to 
surface-level imaging, and incapable of resolving subsurface features. Here, we propose 
an approach that integrates the strengths of dark-field scattering optics and AFM by 
leveraging a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on natural biaxial α-MoO3 
crystals. This method enables ultrahigh-resolution subwavelength imaging with the 
ability to visualize both surface and buried structures, achieving a spatial resolution of 
15 nm and grating pitch detection down to 100 nm. The underlying mechanism relies on 
the unique anisotropic properties of α-MoO3, where its atomic-scale unit cells and biaxial 
symmetry facilitate the diffraction-free propagation of both evanescent and propagating 
waves via a flat-band canalization regime. Unlike metamaterial-based superlenses and 
hyperlenses, which suffer from high plasmonic losses, fabrication imperfections, and 
uniaxial constraints, α-MoO3 provides robust and aberration-free imaging in multiple 
directions. We successfully applied this approach to achieve high-resolution inspection of 
buried nanoscale electronic circuits, offering unprecedented capabilities essential for 
next-generation semiconductor manufacturing. 
 
Since the advent of integrated circuits, optical inspection technology has been a cornerstone of 
semiconductor wafer manufacturing, providing a fast and non-destructive approach to defect 
detection and quality control, including bright-field and dark-field scattering techniques, plays 
a key role in ensuring production yields, but it faces fundamental limitations when nanoscale 
precision is required1-4. For instance, bright-field detection offers high resolution but struggles 
with low defect contrast6, while dark-field methods can effectively highlight surface defects 
but fail to detect subsurface features71,8. Atomic force microscopy partially overcomes the 
resolution barrier, offering nanoscale precision for surface measurements. However, AFM is 
restricted to surface imaging, and incapable of penetrating layers to reveal buried structures, 
greatly limiting its applicability for inspecting advanced multi-layered semiconductor

devices.4,6 As the semiconductor industry approaches the physical limits of Moore’s law, the 
increasing complexity of AI and quantum chips has driven the need for novel inspection 
technologies capable of probing multi-dimensional structures, including deeply buried features, 
while maintaining high resolution and throughput. 
Here, we propose an innovative method that integrates dark-field scattering optics and 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on αMoO₃. This hybrid approach enables ultrahigh-resolution subwavelength imaging, capable of 
resolving deeply buried features and overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional 
optical and AFM methods. Specifically, our system achieves a remarkable resolution of 15 nm, 
surpassing the capabilities of traditional optical detection limited by diffraction and AFM’s 
surface-bound imaging. While scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) has previously 
demonstrated its potential to achieve nanoscale imaging through near-field interactions, its 
effectiveness has often been restricted by the properties of uniaxial materials such as hexagonal 
boron nitride (hBN). Subwavelength imaging using hBN and other hyperbolic metamaterials, 
which rely on gapped hyperbolic dispersions, suffers from the image magnification effect and 
momentum mismatch, leading to losses and aberrations in the transmitted geometric 
information (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the uniaxial nature of these materials, characterized by 
identical in-plane permittivity components, limits imaging to a single direction (Fig. 1c), 
making multidirectional imaging unattainable. Despite their successes, these limitations 
highlight the need for more advanced materials and methods to unlock the full potential of 
near-field imaging.

which leads to unavoidable aberration. The upper plane shows photonic dispersions of the 
imaging lens (red solid lines in blue shaded region), and the lower plane (blue solid lines) 
shows dispersions of the objects. The black dashed vertical lines are the equal-kx lines, which 
intersect with the dispersions at positions L1 (-L1) and L2 (-L2), respectively. The gray shaded

as layered hyperbolic metamaterials and hBN crystal. (d) Imaging in three directions can be 
achieved by biaxial media such as α-MoO3 crystal proposed in this work. X, Y and Z: 
subwavelength objects and images across respective lens planes. 
 
In contrast, the natural biaxial vdW crystal α-MoO₃ overcomes these challenges by offering 
unique anisotropic properties with distinct permittivity components along orthogonal crystal 
axes. These properties allow precise control of light propagation, enabling the diffraction-free 
transmission of all wavevector components through its gapless flat dispersions (Fig. 1b). As a 
result, highly collimated and canalized phonon polariton (PhP) modes propagate with constant 
longitudinal momentum, carrying geometric information without loss or aberration. Unlike 
systems based on artificial superlenses or hyperlenses, which are limited by fabrication 
imperfections, plasmonic losses, and large meta-atom sizes, α-MoO₃ achieves near-lossless 
subwavelength imaging through its naturally occurring anisotropy. More importantly, 
compared to conventional optical and AFM methods, α-MoO₃-based imaging enables robust 
visualization of both surface and buried structures with exceptional resolution and stability. 
Furthermore, the canalization mechanism ensures consistent imaging performance even when 
the object-to-imaging-plane distance varies (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2), 
establishing α-MoO₃ as a transformative solution for next-generation multidimensional, highresolution inspection technologies. 
 
From Figure 2a, the α-MoO3 imaging device consists of an α-MoO3 slab positioned on top 
of subdiffractional objects made of Au nanopatterns. Imaging can be achieved through the flatband canalization of PhPs in the mid-infrared range. In particular, the permittivity values of

orthorhombic α-MoO3 undergo three significant transitions, shifting from positive to negative 
along the orthogonal axes over the range (Fig. 2b and the inset), while hexagonal hBN only has 
two such transitions23. Notably, this unique feature of α-MoO3 leads to subwavelength imaging 
in three directions (Fig. 1d), respectively, as revealed by theoretical modelling in 
Supplementary Note 1. This imaging character is barely attainable in previously reported 
plasmonic or metamaterial lenses due to higher structural and optical symmetries. Furthermore, 
these topological transitions induce the flat bands of PhPs in α-MoO3, which is nontrivial for 
super-resolution subwavelength imaging. Similar topological transitions have been recently 
observed in twisted bilayers of -MoO3 42-45 and graphene/-MoO3 heterostructures46-48 with 
in-plane canalization and diffractionless propagation of PhPs; however, the application of this 
mechanism for imaging remains largely unexplored.

suggest the canalization regime of low-loss phonon polaritons, which is used to restore the 
images through -MoO3. The arrows on the ultraflat curve, that is, the Poynting vectors of 
polaritons with the almost same radial direction, indicate the diffractionless polariton 
propagation along certain directions. (f-h) Imaging in three directions at multiple frequencies 
with -MoO3. Simulated cross-section electric field distributions (|E|) of a 500 nm-thick -
MoO3 lens show deep-subwavelength imaging in three directions respectively of two closelypacked Au objects with an interparticle gap of 15 nm. 
 
Topological transitions and canalization regimes exist in all the three directions for a single 
layer -MoO3. As shown in Fig. 2c-e, the isofrequency contours (IFCs) in the z and x directions 
of α-MoO3 evolve from hyperbolic to elliptical and then 90o-rotated hyperbolic shapes, while 
the IFCs in the y direction directly transit from elliptical to hyperbolic. Near the topological 
transition frequencies, both the hyperbolic and elliptical IFCs are strongly flattened (for more 
details, see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. 3-5). Thus, extremely collimated 
and canalized PhP modes carrying the geometric information can propagate simultaneously 
with a constant longitudinal momentum and a fixed upward direction along the z direction of 
α-MoO3, which will be utilized to restore the super-resolution images by α-MoO3. This 
conceptual hypothesis has been confirmed by the numerically simulated field distributions of 
a 500 nm-thick -MoO3 lens (Fig. 2f-h); this theoretically enables subwavelength imaging in 
three directions. Moreover, the -MoO3 lens provides extra options with multiple canalizationbased imaging frequencies from around 540 cm-1 to 960 cm-1 while only one imaging frequency 
is allowed for a conventional uniaxial lens. 
 
To experimentally observe the topological transition and subwavelength images, we used a 
real-space optical technique to directly map the objects through scattering-type scanning nearfield optical microscopy (s-SNOM). An oscillating tip under free-space illumination acts as a 
near-field probe as the surface of the α-MoO3 imaging device is scanned. This technique allows 
the simultaneous recording of nanoscale-resolved near-field images with topography. Figure 
3a-c shows the near-field images of 93 nm-thick α-MoO3 on top of a 500 nm-diameter Au disk 
under light illumination of 897, 957 and 995 cm−1, respectively. The wavefronts and

dispersions of PhPs change from hyperbolic to elliptical shapes, revealing a topological 
transition (Supplementary Fig. 6). These in-plane elliptical wavefronts arise from the out-ofplane hyperbolic dispersion of α-MoO3 in nature as shown in Fig. 2c and e. When the out-ofplane hyperbolicity reduces to nearly flat contours, both the elliptical and hyperbolic 
wavefronts disappear, restoring the images of the underlying objects at the surface of α-MoO3 
(Fig. 3b).

and 250 nm (j), respectively. Scale bars for height, 10 nm. Insets show schematics of the 
corresponding Au disk in h-j. 
 
To theoretically validate our experimental results, we performed three-dimensional full-wave 
simulations based on the finite element method. The above experimental observations are 
effectively verified by the numerically simulated images (Fig. 3d-f). The cross-section field 
distributions at the topological transition show that PhP modes propagate upwards with 
indistinguishable diffraction. This is reflected by extracting line profiles across the Au disk 
(Fig. 3g), with only one strong signal and a steep intensity rise/fall at 957 cm−1. The near-field 
signal greatly resembles the topographic shape of the Au disk (Fig. 3h). The PhP canalization 
and hyperlensing effect are also verified in Au disks of different sizes (Fig. 3i and j and 
Supplementary Fig. 7). For example, the image signal and the topographic signal of a 250 nm 
object (λ/41.8) are almost the same considering the peak width. Note that the dark annular 
regions in Fig. 3b and the signal intensity drop in Fig. 3i and j are attributed to the spreading 
of suspension of α-MoO3 around the Au disks, indicating that polariton canalization is highly 
sensitive to the dielectric environment.

To explore the imaging limit of α-MoO3, we designed and fabricated two sets of L-shaped 
objects with deep subwavelength sizes, as shown in Fig. 4. Two sets of samples are examined: 
reduced spacings down to 68 nm between two Au disks (Fig. 4a), and extremely narrow Au 
lines as small as 15 nm in width (Fig. 4e). α-MoO3 exhibits ultrahigh imaging resolution at the 
frequency where the PhP canalization occurs. Although the Au nanostructures are completely 
masked by the α-MoO3 layer, the device can effectively resolve the interparticle gaps and Au 
lines beyond the diffraction limit. Figure 4b shows the topography image of an as-made 200 
nm-thick α-MoO3 imaging device; here, the closely packed Au disks (Fig. 4a) are encased 
between a large-area α-MoO3 crystal and the SiO2/Si substrate, with a 12 nm hump at the 
hyperlens surface, which may affect the imaging resolution. The recorded images at 957 cm−1 
are displayed in Fig. 4c and d; underlying L-shaped disks with discernible interparticle spacings 
are observed. The imaging resolution is not influenced by the tip scanning directions, indicating 
that the intrinsic PhP modes account for the aberration-free imaging performance. Detailed 
analysis shows that a high resolution of λ/97 is achieved when illuminating the 68 nm spacing 
at 957 cm−1 (for more details, see Supplementary Fig. 8).

More strikingly, α-MoO3 exhibits the capability to resolve the objects with a size down to 15 
nm; this achievement has not been attained in previously reported superlenses or hyperlenses. 
Notably, the 15 nm feature size has already exceeded the limitation of our near-field 
microscopy with an AFM tip radius of ~25 nm, which might compromise the intrinsic resolving 
capability of α-MoO3. Extremely narrow Au lines (Fig. 4e) were fabricated by milling two 
holes in a Au film via ultrahigh-resolution focused ion beam (FIB) lithography. In this case, 
the topography of a 230-nm-thick α-MoO3 device showed an ultraflat surface, without the 
characteristic hump as those for the disk objects, which could further minimize the external 
effects on imaging performance. Two images recorded at 957 cm−1 and 967 cm−1 are displayed 
in Fig. 4g and h, respectively. The entire Au nanopatterns were clearly recovered, as shown in 
Fig. 4e, with a relatively weak contrast for the line with a 15 nm width. Nonetheless, a decent 
peak corresponding to the 15-nm-wide line could be clearly observed in each linescan from 
957 to 967 cm−1 (Fig. 4i). By analysing the peak width at 967 cm−1, we obtained a resolution 
of λ/71.2 for the 15-nm-wide line (Fig. 4j). Notably, the highest resolution up to λ/113 was 
achieved for the 29-nm-wide line (Fig. 4k). For the objects aligned along the y direction, a 
maximum resolution of λ/78 was achieved for the 52 nm line. More images and analysis are 
available in Supplementary Fig. 9. Notably, all resolutions achieved by α-MoO3, regardless of 
the anisotropic resolving feature, were higher than those with hBN imaging. 
 
In addition to high resolution, superior imaging characteristics of high fidelity induced by 
ultraflat polariton dispersions are also achievable. While resolution represents the capability of 
a lens to resolve objects, fidelity quantifies the quality of the high-resolution images, and this 
factor was often overlooked or unattainable in previously reported hyperlenses or superlenses. 
However, the α-MoO3 imaging exhibits exceptional image fidelity, with a maximum value of 
74% in the x direction at 967 cm−1 and 40% in the y direction; this was calculated based on the 
ratio of the Au line width to the FWHM (Fig. 4l).

To fully examine the capability of imaging linear objects, we fabricated an imaging device with 
210 nm-thick α-MoO3 on top of a Au nanoribbon array. Figure 5a shows an FIB image of the 
Au nanoribbon array object with an average line width of 50 nm and a period of 100 nm written 
on Au film. The recorded field patterns at the image plane in Fig. 5b and c clearly show the 
profiles of the gratings captured by α-MoO3 in both real space and momentum space. High 
spatial frequencies, at least the grating’s third harmonics, are imaged by -MoO3 for both

gratings oriented along the x and y directions (Supplementary Fig. 10). Thus, α-MoO3 imaging 
can restore the details of the nanoscale linear patterns benefitting from diffraction-free 
canalization-based imaging properties, as discussed above. 
 
Finally, we use α-MoO3 imaging in an industrial application scenario in microelectronics. 
During the wafer fabrication process, the electronic devices are always protected by thin cap 
layers but need defect inspection and review; this is a critical part of outgoing wafer 
qualification. In this regard, a “CPU” pattern with conductive Au traces and a SiO2 
encapsulation layer resembling the processing unit of electronic chips (Fig. 5d) was fabricated. 
The measured image in Fig. 5e shows that the fine features of the underlying “CPU” object can 
be effectively reproduced with excellent fidelity. In particular, the bright spots in the recorded 
image (Fig. 5e) arise from localized polariton scattering, indicating residue or embedded 
particles along the Au traces. More importantly, the image shows the two locations of the 
artificial break or damage etched by high-resolution FIB (see two squared regions in Fig. 5d). 
The break with a deep subwavelength gap of 40 nm is efficiently resolved by a 240-nm-thick 
α-MoO3 lens, as shown in the zoomed-in images of Fig. 5f-h. Due to this canalization-based 
imaging capability, α-MoO3 is capable of quality control and break diagnosis for electronic 
circuits at the nanoscale. 
 
We compared the resolving and imaging capability of α-MoO3 canalization lens in our study 
to those of previously reported superlenses and hyperlenses (see Supplementary Fig. 11 and 
Table 1 for more details). Generally, natural hyperbolic crystal lenses have higher imaging 
resolutions than plasmonic and metamaterial lenses, which suffer from high losses and 
imperfect fabrication. For example, the SiC superlens can resolve air holes with a diameter of 
540 nm milled in the Au film at 11 m13; however, its resolution has recently been improved 
with synthetic waves of complex frequency14, and a pair of Au holes with edge-to-edge 
separation of 40 nm was able to be resolved. In contrast, the monoisotopic h11BN hyperlens is 
able to resolve an interparticle gap of 25 nm by using an image reconstruction algorithm31. In 
our study, α-MoO3 is able to directly resolve an object as small as 15 nm, that is, a size of 
0.00145; this resolution is among the best recorded to date. 
 
The ultrahigh resolution of α-MoO3 imaging is attributed to its inherent low loss and 
indefinitely large anisotropy. α-MoO3 has an extremely low optical loss, which differs from 

===== Page 13 =====

13 
 
the high plasmonic loss in metamaterials23,49 and large phonon damping in hBN ( ~ 3 and 7.3 
cm-1, respectively, for two Reststrahlen bands23, while  ~ 1.5 cm-1 for α-MoO3 in the out-ofplane direction50). More importantly, the extremely large anisotropy in α-MoO3 enables precise 
diffraction control, resulting in flat-band polariton canalization with flattened gapless 
dispersions for ultrahigh-resolution canalization lens. Furthermore, these imaging channels 
exist in three directions. Different from most uniaxial hyperbolic metamaterials and hBN lenses 
restricting two-dimensional imaging, biaxial MoO3 shows symmetry breaking of both in-plane 
and out-of-plane structural and optical properties, enabling subwavelength imaging in all the 
three directions. Due to limitations of our laser wavelength, we experimentally verified the 
imaging effect at one canalization region as an example. 
 
In conclusion, we demonstrate ultrahigh-resolution deep-subwavelength canalization lens 
fabricated from a lithography-free biaxial vdW crystal; this α-MoO3-based imaging is 
distinctive in comparison to all previously reported subwavelength lenses. We anticipate 
further improved resolution by using synthetic excitation waves of complex frequency14 and 
tuneable imaging by controlling PhPs through intercalation51,52. The imaging frequencies of 
the vdW crystals can also extend from the terahertz to visible range by leveraging the vast 
library of naturally hyperbolic crystals25,26. Moreover, near-field microscopy based on vdW 
crystals can be utilized as an alternative way to resolve and image extremely small 
subwavelength objects that are not directly accessible by a near-field probe. The results from 
our study can be used to advance imaging resolution into a new stage extending beyond the 
diffraction limit and may facilitate opportunities for three-dimensional broadband optical 
imaging of nanostructures and biomolecules based on low-loss vdW material platforms. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Sample fabrication. Thin flakes of α-MoO3 were prepared by mechanical exfoliation of bulk 
van der Waals crystals. The growth of bulk crystals was described in our previous reports40,42. 
Briefly, commercial MoO3 powders (Alfa Aesar) were evaporated and re-deposited inside a 
quartz tube through chemical vapour deposition. The as-grown bulk crystals were mechanically 
exfoliated onto a polydimethylsiloxane thin sheet. Then large and thin α-MoO3 flakes with high 
quality were selected for use. Au disks with different diameters were fabricated on SiO2/Si 
substrates by electron beam lithography, and Au lines were fabricated via focused ion beam

milling. Through deterministic alignment under an optical microscope, the α-MoO3 flake was 
finally transferred onto different Au patterns, forming the imaging device structure. 
Optical measurements. The infrared nano-imaging measurements were performed using a 
scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM, NeaSpec GmbH). In this 
system, a metallic atomic force microscope tip (NanoWorld ARROW-NCPt Probes), 
oscillating at a frequency of ~300 kHz and an amplitude of ~70 nm, was illuminated by the ppolarized infrared light with tuneable frequencies. The resulting nanoscale hotspot at the apex 
of the tip interacts with the sample, with the tip acting as both an infrared antenna and a nearfield probe. A pseudo-heterodyne interferometer was the used to record the tip-scattered field, 
and the second or third harmonics of the tip resonant frequency was demodulated to extract the 
near-field images in this work. 
Numerical simulations. We performed finite element method simulations utilizing the 
'Electromagnetic Waves, Frequency Domain' module of the COMSOL commercial software. 
A perfectly matched layer was applied to the sides of the simulation to eliminate reflections at 
the boundaries.  A transverse magnetic-polarized plane wave was incident vertically from the 
top of the sample. The dielectric permittivity of the α-MoO3 flake was taken from 
references40,41,53. In the simulations shown in Fig. 1g-h, the thickness of α-MoO3 was set as 500 
nm.
