The Dataset section should:
- Describe the data source and scope (e.g., inline metrology, process logs) and the unit of analysis (lot-level, wafer-level).
- Define the target/labeling policy (e.g., low-yield risk definition) without inventing numbers.
- Describe features: types (continuous/categorical), preprocessing (missing values, normalization, encoding), and any filtering rationale.
- Explain the data split strategy (train/validation/test) and how data leakage is prevented.
- Note any data quality issues and assumptions (if applicable).

Writing constraints:
- Formal academic English.
- No headings or bullet lists in the final output; write in coherent paragraphs.
