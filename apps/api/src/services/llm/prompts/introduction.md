The Introduction should:
- Establish the background and motivation in semiconductor manufacturing and yield prediction.
- Clearly define the problem and practical constraints (e.g., variability, data heterogeneity, potential leakage).
- Summarize limitations of prior work in a balanced way (avoid overclaiming).
- State the objective of this work and its main contributions at a high level.
- End with a short preview of the paper structure (optional, if it improves clarity).

Writing constraints:
- Formal academic English.
- No headings or bullet lists in the final output; write in coherent paragraphs.
