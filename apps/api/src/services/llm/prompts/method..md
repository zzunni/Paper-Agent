The Method section should:
- Present the overall pipeline clearly and in order.
- Explain the chosen modeling or statistical approach and why it fits the problem setting.
- Describe how the method handles hierarchical structure (e.g., lot vs. wafer) if relevant.
- Specify the evaluation protocol and metrics conceptually (do not invent results).
- Include implementation details that affect reproducibility at a high level (software stack, main hyperparameters only if provided).

Writing constraints:
- Formal academic English.
- No headings or bullet lists in the final output; write in coherent paragraphs.
